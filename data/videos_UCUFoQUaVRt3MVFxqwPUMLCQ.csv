GHIBLI MOVIES

There are few film studios as celebrated as Studio Ghibli. The legendary animation house has produced groundbreaking work for decades, and shows no sign of slowing. Much of what most people know about Ghibli centers around its co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki, but there is much more to the studio than its famous director.

STUDIO GHIBLI PROCESS

Unlike many contemporary studios that prioritize speed and volume, Ghibli often emphasizes craftsmanship, detail, and the director’s creative vision over strict deadlines or commercial pressures. Miyazaki in particular is known for storyboarding his films in an organic, evolving process rather than beginning with a finished script. This allows narratives to shift and expand during production, sometimes leading to extended timelines but also resulting in films that feel alive and unpredictable. Ghibli's music, too, is massively influential. Joe Hisaishi's score are integral to the studio's reputation.

STUDIO GHIBLI ANIMATION

One of Studio Ghibli’s most distinctive features is its visual style, which combines lush, painterly backgrounds with expressive character animation. The environments in Ghibli films are rendered with extraordinary attention to detail. Food, weather, and landscapes are treated with particular reverence, creating a sense of lived-in realism even within fantastical settings.

GHIBLI NARRATIVES

Narratively, Studio Ghibli films resist the strict structures of traditional Western storytelling. While conflicts exist, they are rarely framed in terms of pure good versus evil. Instead, antagonists are often complex figures with understandable motivations, reflecting a worldview that values empathy and nuance. Films like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke highlight environmental and ethical dilemmas without providing simple solutions. Others, like Kiki’s Delivery Service or Whisper of the Heart, explore themes of growing up, independence, and creativity in quieter, slice-of-life modes.

Above all, the narratives embrace moments of stillness and ambiguity (what Miyazaki refers to as “ma"") that allow audiences to pause, reflect, and simply exist within the film’s world. And these are worlds nobody wants to leave.

WEAPONS EXPLAINED — A SCREENWRITING ANALYSIS

Zach Cregger's Weapons was a huge hit at the box office and became one of the ""must-see"" movies of the year. Many factors contributed to its success, but most of them ultimately come down to the screenplay. In this video, we're diving into the Weapons screenplay, how it was constructed, and what writers can take away from it.

STRUCTURE

First, let's talk about the script's structure. It is a non-linear, ""outside the box"" style that enhances both the character development and the themes. In interviews, Cregger talks about how his motivation for this story came out of traumatic experiences in his life, like the death of his close friend. His different emotions in real life are here represented by different characters. We've seen ensemble films before, but this fragmented, non-linear structure allows us to lock into those different perspectives and emotions one at a time. The structure also allows each chapter to answer previously unknown questions, asking new questions that we anticipate being answered later, and ultimately builds anticipation for the resolution.

TONE

Another masterful element in Weapons is the way it shifts tone so suddenly yet naturally. At times, it's suspenseful and gripping, but then punctuated by bits of comic relief before shifting into pointedly dramatic moments. Cregger's secret for navigating these conflicting tones was grounded in authenticity. Characters reacting how real people would actually react, in other words. So, the humor isn't forced and feels organic to the situation.

THEME

Finally, we look at how the themes in the film are handled. The film is full of symbolism and metaphor, but they are all anchored to a core idea of grief. Having the ensemble of characters and non-linear structure might have otherwise created a chaotic experience, but because he's writing from his personal experience, it feels cohesive. The ambiguities in the film, especially tied to the symbolic elements, function to allow the audience to connect themselves to the material. So any confusion or questions we have while watching aligns us with the characters who are also seeking answers.

Overall, a lot can be learned from studying Zach Cregger's Weapons, no matter if you're looking to write a horror film or not. When real emotions are expressed through authentic and grounded characters, the audience will connect and appreciate the experience.

FILM FORMATS EXPLAINED

Just as there are different cameras, lenses, and equipment, the type of film format you use has a direct impact on the images you create. Knowing the differences, considering their costs, and making the best choice for your particular project is a big step in filmmaking. In this video, we will cover all of the major film formats so that you can make an informed decision.

8MM & SUPER 8MM

All film formats tend to be referred to by their film gauge (width), which is expressed in millimeters. At the smaller end of the spectrum, we have 8mm and Super 8mm. Both were developed as formats for home use. The smaller stock and smaller cameras were ideal for amateurs to record home movies. This proliferated through the 20th century and it became the visual shorthand for ""nostalgia.""

16MM & SUPER 16MM

Both 16mm formats provide a bridge between the limited simplicity of 8mm and the cinematic presentation of 35mm. For filmmakers, these film formats thrive in a grittier look where the film grain becomes more pronounced, especially when ""blown up"" for 35mm distribution and projection. Filmmakers like Wes Anderson and Darren Aronofsky have shot films with these formats for that exact reason.

35MM

This has been the standard format for nearly a century before digital filmmaking took over. It has more resolution and less grain than the smaller formats, and has become the benchmark for cinematic imagery. There are four types of 35mm, The size of each frame can be dictated by how many perforations are used. This could be 2, 3 or 4-perf versions, changing the native aspect ratio with each additional perforation.

65MM / 70MM / IMAX

Large-format cinematography has rapidly become the go-to option for large-scale, event-driven spectacles like Nope, Oppenheimer, and Sinners. The size and resolution of these film formats rival even the best digital sensors. They're the most expensive, so their use is limited to big-budget productions, but when it comes to the quality of the image, there's nothing better.

DIGITAL

Most films are now shot and projected digitally. In the last two decades, the quality of digital sensors has grown exponentially. Coupled with the lower cost, it's no wonder it has become the most commonly used medium.

STUDIOBINDER'S FILM SCHEDULING SOFTWARE

Film scheduling can be tedious and frustrating, or at least it used to be. StudioBinder's shooting schedule software is integrated with the script so that each scene is auto-populated on the stripboard. From there, you can drag and drop individual scenes into a workable schedule. Or scenes can be auto-sorted based on time of day, location, and many other variations, giving you complete flexibility. Either way, your shooting schedule is assembled in no time.

Add day breaks to demarcate your shooting days. Add banners to account for meal breaks and company moves — this way, you can tally up each shoot day down to the minute. With the schedule completed, get feedback from your department heads directly on the schedule to keep your collaboration precise and organized. And, finally, spin off call sheets directly from the stripboard, fully populated and ready for distribution.

A proper shooting schedule is your key to an efficient shooting day.

PRODUCTION DESIGN FILM

When we talk about a film's look, we often focus on the role of the director and the cinematographer. Some directors are household names, and film buffs are always talking about their favorite cinematographers. Even devoted cinephiles, however, often can't name their top production designer. And yet production design is integral to a film, perhaps just as much as a movie's cinematography. In this video, we finally give the art department its due.

WHAT DOES A PRODUCTION DESIGNER DO?

The production designer is responsible for shaping the overall look and visual identity of a film, ensuring that every detail supports the story and its themes. Working closely with the director and cinematographer, the production designer translates abstract ideas into concrete environments. If the director envisions a gritty, urban drama, the production designer determines what that city looks like: what kind of streets the characters walk down, what sort of apartments they live in, and what textures or colors dominate their world. The role involves both creative vision and practical problem-solving.

ELEMENTS OF THE BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN

Production design encompasses a wide range of visual elements that together create the world of a film. Set design and construction form the backbone, but beyond architecture, the choice of props contributes to character development and mood. Color schemes play a vital role in guiding audience emotions. Texture, scale, and lighting considerations also influence how environments feel on screen. Costume design, though technically considered its own department, is deeply linked to production design, as clothing choices should harmonize with sets and props.

ART DIRECTION, SET DESIGN, AND MORE

While the production designer oversees the visual concept, they rely on an entire art department to bring it to life. The art director serves as the key collaborator, translating the designer’s ideas into detailed plans and supervising their execution. Set decorators fill spaces with furniture, artwork, and objects that make the environment feel lived-in. These roles, and many more, contribute specialized skills and ensure that the production design supports the story with depth and authenticity.

Production design is indispensable— it can make or break the look of a film. Don't sleep on it.

RESERVOIR DOGS EXPLAINED

There are few directorial debuts as good as Reservoir Dogs. A great debut is hard to come by, since often directors are still learning their craft and figuring out what their voice is. But Quentin Tarantino arrived fully formed, with all of the qualities that he would become famous for already on display. So what lessons can we take from Reservoir Dogs and its production?

QUENTIN TARANTINO ON WRITING RESERVOIR DOGS

Tarantino’s journey began not with industry connections, but with a screenplay. Having spent years working at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, he immersed himself in the world of cinema, studying everything from crime thrillers to exploitation films. He then wrote something he could realistically make. Reservoir Dogs was designed around contained settings making it feasible for a low budget. Aspiring directors can learn from this pragmatic approach: your first script doesn’t have to be small in ambition, but it should be manageable in scale.

RESERVOIR DOGS CAST

Casting proved to be the turning point in moving Reservoir Dogs from a scrappy indie into a professional production. Initially, Tarantino planned to shoot the film on 16mm with friends playing the parts. But when veteran actor Harvey Keitel read the script and agreed to both star in and help produce the film, its budget grew exponentially. Keitel’s involvement not only legitimized the project but also attracted a roster of professional actors including Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and Tim Roth.

BEHIND THE SCENES OF RESERVOIR DOGS

On set, Tarantino faced the challenges every first-time director must overcome: balancing creative ambition with the practical limitations of time and money. His solution was to lean into style. He used long takes, carefully chosen pop songs, and careful coverage to create suspense without stretching his resources.

What aspiring directors can take from this is the importance of resourceful creativity. Tarantino didn’t shy away from his budgetary constraints; he embraced them and built his film’s identity around them. His debut shows that directing isn’t just about executing a vision-- it’s about adapting that vision to the realities of production while still delivering something bold and distinctive. Hey, anyone can do it, right?

GREAT MOVIES TO WATCH: SORCERER

Filmmakers fear a shoot like the one William Friedkin experienced for ""Sorcerer."" It's a production's worst nightmare: impossible locations, constant injuries, huge egos. And yet, filmmakers would also do anything to make a movie like ""Sorcerer."" In this video, we take a look at the oft-forgotten classic, and examine what makes it so good (even if critics didn't think as much at the time).

SORCERER MOVIE EXPLAINED

""Sorcerer"" is based on Georges Arnaud’s 1950 novel The Wages of Fear, which had already been adapted into Henri-Georges Clouzot’s widely-celebrated 1953 film of the same name. Friedkin’s version is often mistakenly considered a straightforward remake of Clouzot’s work, but it functions more as a reimagining filtered through the sensibilities of 1970s American cinema. The story remains the same at its core: four desperate men in a South American backwater are hired to drive two trucks laden with volatile nitroglycerin across treacherous terrain. But Friedkin significantly expands the backstory of each character. The opening sequences ground each man in his own failure or crime, lending the central journey greater moral weight.

SORCERER MAKING OF

Visually, ""Sorcerer"" is one of Friedkin’s most striking achievements. Shot on location, the jungle is not just a backdrop but an active antagonist, swallowing everything in the frame. Friedkin’s documentary-style realism translates here into a suffocating sensation. Every frame feels damp and muddy.

The centerpiece of the film, and arguably one of the greatest action sequences ever committed to film, is the crossing of the rope suspension bridge during a violent storm. The sequence is both spectacular and terrifying because Friedkin shot it practically. The sequence, like much of the film, derives its suspense not from quick edits or effects but from the raw, physical danger communicated through the camera.

THE SCORE AND TANGERINE DREAM

The film’s atmosphere owes a lot to its score, composed by Tangerine Dream. Minimal and eerie, it primarily comprises ghostly synth textures. The music underscores the film’s bleakness, often evoking dread rather than adrenaline. In its spareness and electronic timbre, Tangerine Dream’s work proved influential, foreshadowing the rise of synthesizer-driven scores.

""Sorcerer"" is one of a kind not just because it's a great movie, but because no one has been insane enough to try to accomplish something like it again. Considering what Friedkin went through to accomplish it, and the lack of any reward he recieved, that's no surprise.

DOGME 95 EXPLAINED

In the grand arc of cinema history, Dogme 95 was just a flash in the pan. It lasted for less than a decade, and resulted in only a few dozen movies, most of which broke its famously strict rules. And yet Dogme has had a long shadow: it's influence is inarguable and massive. So what is Dogme? And why is it important?

LARS VON TRIER AND THOMAS VINTERBERG

Dogme 95 was a radical filmmaking movement launched in 1995 by Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. Conceived as a reaction against the growing artificiality in mainstream cinema, the movement sought to strip filmmaking down to its purest essentials. Von Trier and Vinterberg issued the “Dogme 95 Manifesto” alongside a set of strict guidelines they called the “Vow of Chastity.” Their aim was to shift focus away from special effects, artificial production design, and the director’s personal artistic flourishes, placing emphasis instead on story, performance, and the truth of the moment.

DOGME 95 MANIFESTO RULES

The rules of Dogme 95 were famously uncompromising (and to some, ridiculous). Filmmakers agreeing to the Vow of Chastity committed themselves to shooting entirely on location without bringing in props or sets not already present at the location. Sound and image were to be recorded together, meaning no post-dubbed music or sound effects. In practice, filmmakers often bent or even broke these rules, but the spirit of Dogme lay in the attempt to adhere to them as much as possible.

DOGME 95 MOVEMENT INFLUENCE

The influence of Dogme 95 spread quickly, both within and beyond Denmark. The movement inspired over thirty ""officially certified"" Dogme films, made in countries ranging from France to the United States (with Harmony Korine) to South Korea. While the manifesto itself was retired in 2005, its principles continued to shape independent filmmaking long after. The handheld camerawork, natural lighting, and improvisational performances seen in Dogme films prefigured the aesthetics of later movements such as mumblecore in the U.S. and the broader trend toward cinéma vérité–style realism (think mumblecore and its ilk). Its ethos also seeped into mainstream cinema; directors who were not officially part of Dogme adopted some of its stripped-down techniques for their own projects.

Dogme 95 reinvigorated the conversation about what cinema could be when freed from the pressure to conform to Hollywood spectacle. Do we need another one?

WHAT IS HYPERBOLE?

Where would we be without hyperbole? How could we declare our love for someone? How could we adequately state how hungry we are? Happy we are? Angry? Hyperbole has a myriad of uses, but its core purpose is to emphasize. When we say ""I love you to the moon and back,"" we are using hyperbole to emphasize the magnitude of our love. So how can this figure of speech be used in movies? We take a look.

HYPERBOLE LITERARY TERM

The most common form of hyperbole is verbal. Verbal hyperbole emerges in dialogue that pushes expression beyond the bounds of literal truth. Characters declare things that are far larger, grander, or more extreme than reality– not to deceive, but to communicate the depth of their feelings or convictions. It is a kind of emotional shorthand, condensing a state of mind into a line that can be instantly understood.

HYPERBOLE IN MOVIES

Visual hyperbole operates through imagery and design. A set might be built to an impossible scale, a movement might defy physical limits, or the framing of a shot might distort proportion to intensify impact. Editing can stretch or compress time for dramatic effect, while lighting and color can be pushed far beyond naturalism to evoke a heightened mood.

GENRE HYPERBOLE LITERARY DEVICES

Some genres embrace hyperbole so completely that it becomes part of their identity. Comedy often thrives on overstatement, playing situations to the point of absurdity to provoke laughter. Melodrama leans into emotional excess, giving every feeling a sense of epic magnitude. Musicals lift the ordinary into the extraordinary, where bursts of song and dance transform the simplest action into a moment of spectacle.

In film, hyperbole is less of a distortion of truth so much as a magnification of it. By amplifying language, images, and genre conventions, filmmakers invite audiences into an intensified version of reality. In the end, isn't that what movies are for?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL HERO'S JOURNEY EXPLAINED

There are a lot of story structures out there, but none are as influential as Joseph Campbell's monomyth. Regardless of the story you're trying to tell, the outline Campbell laid out nearly a century ago will undoubtably prove useful. But why exactly has the monomyth remained so influential? And how has it evolved over time?

THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES EXPLAINED

Joseph Campbell’s concept of the Hero’s Journey, introduced in ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces,"" identifies a narrative pattern underlying mythic storytelling across cultures: a lone hero ventures beyond the familiar, faces trials, gains wisdom, and returns transformed. Campbell rooted his framework in psychology, particularly Jungian archetypes, and his ideas deeply influenced writers and filmmakers.

THE HERO'S JOURNEY IN FILM

In the early aughts, Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood story analyst, modernized Campbell’s ideas for screenwriters. Vogler translated Campbell’s academic structure into a clear, twelve-step model tailored for contemporary narrative, especially film. Vogler’s twelve stages of the Hero’s Journey are:

Ordinary World
Call to Adventure
Refusal of the Call
Meeting with the Mentor
Crossing the First Threshold
Tests, Allies, and Enemies
Approach to the Inmost Cave
Ordeal
Reward (Seizing the Sword)
The Road Back
Resurrection
Return with the Elixir

WHAT IS THE HERO'S JOURNEY

Vogler’s framework for the Hero’s Journey has become foundational in Hollywood screenwriting. Together, Campbell and Vogler offer a template for storytelling that blends mythic resonance with practical utility-- timeless in theme, yet adaptable to modern audiences and media.

SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCES

Dreams are a crucial element of movies. Since the beginning of the medium, directors have been experimenting with how to represent the imagery that comes to our minds when we sleep. In our previous episode, we looked at how a dream sequence looks on the page. Today, we're looking at how it's filmed. More often than not, filmmakers will test their craft when approaching dreams, experimenting in ways that may not be possible in the rest of their narrative.

DREAM SEQUENCE CINEMATOGRAPHY

Cinematography plays a central role in establishing the unreal atmosphere of a dream. Lighting, lensing, and camera movement can all shift subtly (or dramatically) to indicate a departure from waking life. Lighting in dream sequences often leans into extremes: overexposure, heavy shadows, or abrupt camera placement. Cinematographers will often use soft focus to blur the edges of reality or, conversely, ultra-sharp images to heighten the uncanny. The key is intentional contrast– dreams are visually coded as different, and cinematography provides the most immediate cues.

FILM DREAM SEQUENCE PRODUCTION DESIGN

The world of a dream is built differently than the waking world. Production design is crucial in shaping this altered space, whether through literal surrealism or subtle environmental distortions. One common strategy is to alter familiar locations in subtle ways. Conversely, a dream set may be completely divorced from reality: scale and proportion might be deliberately inconsistent, or impossibly expansive landscapes can mirror the instability of a dream logic. Design here doesn’t need to obey physics– that's the fun.

DREAM SEQUENCE EDITING

Editing is the final tool that transforms filmed images into a believable dream sequence. In contrast to classical continuity editing, dream sequences often employ more associative or disjointed montage cutting. Abrupt jump cuts, temporal loops, or simple dissolves simulate the fluid, nonlinear structure of dreams.

Sound is equally important. Dream sequences frequently incorporate echoing voices, reversed sounds (looking at you, Lynch), or exaggerated ambiance. Music might be slowed down or detuned, or cut in and out abruptly.

Taken together, these elements allow filmmakers to eschew realism and enter an avant garde space. The best dream sequences feel intangibly ""off"" in a way that only dreams can feel.

ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE STEADICAM

For over five decades now, one piece of equipment has revolutionized how films are shot — The Steadicam. It made the impossible possible when it comes to camera movement and in this video we're going to break down that history, explain how it works, and give you some tips on how to use it.

WHAT IS A STEADICAM

Developed by Garrett Brown in the mid-1970s, the Steadicam is a mobile camera stabilizer composed of three basic components: the vest, the arm, and the sled. The vest is worn by the camera operator, who attaches it to a mechanical arm that helps stabilize the sled on which the camera is mounted. Now, the operator can move in and around a space, up stairs, and in many ways previously impossible unless you opted for the shaky handheld approach. The sled is counterbalanced, allowing the camera to make small, smooth movements.

WHY USE A STEADICAM

When you want the benefits of stabilization (like a tripod or dolly) but also the freedom of handheld maneuvers, the Steadicam is one of the best options. Other stabilizers like gimbals provide a similar effect, but there are some limitations there. Steadicams are also great for long takes with intricate blocking and staging. And because they require no additional equipment, such as a crane or dolly track, a set can be captured in 360 degrees.

There have been numerous innovations since the Steadicam, and they all provide filmmakers with amazing opportunities for steady shots and magical cinematic moments.

SINNERS MOVIE

There had been no doubt that Ryan Coogler was a filmmaker to watch, but after Sinners, he's solidified himself as a powerhouse director. Coogler's newest film is a rare breed these days: an original blockbuster with complex ideas and themes. So how did Coogler pull off what much of Hollywood thought was impossible? Let's dive in.

SINNERS TWIN BEHIND THE SCENES

A standout technical challenge was creating the illusion of twin brothers both played by Michael B. Jordan. This was accomplished through a combination of nuanced performances from Jordan and high-tech cinematic equipment. A good old fashioned body double was occasionally used as well. Taken together, the effect is seamless.

SINNERS CINEMATOGRAPHY

The cinematography, helmed by Coogler’s longtime collaborator Autumn Durald Arkapaw, has been a massive selling point for the film. Shot using both IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70, Sinners becomes the first film to blend these two formats. This duality isn’t just a gimmick: it serves the story. The visuals lean heavily into desaturated tones, evoking Depression-era photography and the muted palette of the Deep South. Stylized lighting is used to great effect, with much of the film lit through windows or firelight, heightening the film’s mythic mood.

SINNERS BREAKDOWN LOCATION

Grounding all of this is the film’s authentic 1932 Mississippi setting, recreated with a blend of practical builds and on-location shoots. Production designer Hannah Beachler constructed key sets, including a dilapidated sawmill-turned-juke joint and a crossroads general store, using historically accurate materials. The attention to period texture extended to the costume design as well. Ruth E. Carter assembled wardrobes that drew on 1930s Southern textiles died with era-specific pigments for realism.

All these elements come together to create an unforgettable movie. But remember: it all started with an original idea.

VISUAL STYLE OF WES ANDERSON

As the man himself will tell you, everyone can pick out a Wes Anderson movie within the first five seconds of watching it. Anderson has been honing his visual style for decades now, creating a more and more idiosyncratic language that separates him from everyone else. There have been a trillion words written about the Wes Anderson aesthetic– but in this video we look a little closer. Where does this style come from, and why is it becoming more defined? We argue that it comes from Anderson's fixation on the nature of storytelling itself.

WES ANDERSON STYLE ANALYSIS

Wes Anderson’s signature aesthetic often draws criticism for being overly artificial. But his frequent use of stories within stories works to justify this visual approach. By framing his narratives, Anderson gives himself license to lean into artifice. The audience is not being asked to believe they’re watching real life unfold but rather a recollection or interpretation filtered through someone’s perspective. The layered storytelling invites viewers into a constructed world that is intentionally curated and theatrical. This narrative distance validates Anderson’s precise mise-en-scene: we are not in reality, but in a memory, a legend, a fictionalized account.

WES ANDERSON STYLE TREND IN WRITING

Anderson’s writing thrives on structure, stylization, and self-reflexivity– all traits well-suited to the nested narrative format. The use of frame narratives allows him to incorporate different tones and voices while maintaining a controlled narrative arc. His characters often speak in clipped, overly-articulate dialogue, and embedding stories within other stories allows him to treat narration itself as a character. This meta-awareness complements Anderson’s literary sensibilities and love for compartmentalized storytelling, where chapters mirror the structure of the films themselves.

WES ANDERSON MOVIE THEMES

At its core, Anderson’s use of stories within stories reflects his fascination with memory and artistic creation. His characters are often grappling with the past: they try to make sense of it in a way that grants it coherence or dignity. These frames create emotional distance, allowing both characters and audiences to process grief or nostalgia indirectly. Of course, Anderson himself is a storyteller, so nested narratives let him analyze his own motivations for creation and control.

So before you write of Wes Anderson's newer films as parodies of a style he's created– give him a little more credit. Maybe he's just getting started.

FILM DREAM SEQUENCE

We all dream (whether or not we remember it), and so it should come as no surprise that since the beginning of cinema, filmmakers have been depicting their characters' dreams. The nature of dreams allow filmmakers to experiment and push boundaries, resulting in some dream sequences becoming some of the most iconic cinematic moments of all time. Like with pretty much any other scene, dream sequences start on the page. So how do you write a dream sequence?

WRITING A DREAM SEQUENCE FOR CHARACTER

When writing a dream to explore characterization, it’s important to ask what the core of your character is: what are their wants? Their fears? A dream can externalize internal conflict, revealing insecurities, suppressed desires, or lingering guilt. Focus on emotional logic rather than narrative logic. How the dream feels is usually more important than what it means in a literal sense. A well-written dream sequence typically leaves the audience with a clearer sense of who the character is, even if the dream itself is abstract.

MOVIE DREAM SEQUENCES FOR NARRATIVE

Dreams can also be used to push the narrative forward. In some instances, dreams are used to deliver warnings, unlock repressed memories, or provide a thematic mirror to the main plot. Alternatively, dream might more subtly influence a character’s decisions or offer them new information. A dream that drives the story forward or reframes it will feel integrated and purposeful, rather than like a detour.

DREAM SCREENPLAY FORMAT

In terms of screenwriting, there is no one way to format a dream. Most screenwriters indicate the start of a dream with a note in the scene heading. It’s usually good practice to make the transition into and out of the dream as clear as possible, so the viewer and production team know where the dream begins and ends. But this isn't always the case— if you don't want a scene to be obviously a dream at first for the audience, then don't make it obvious until after the fact.

When used well, a dream sequence blends experimentation and narrative storytelling to create something unforgettable.

NOUVELLE VAGUE

If you know anything about cinema history, you've probably heard about the French New Wave (or La Nouvelle Vague). The movement is widely considered to be one of the most influential in movie history, and it continues to shape how films are made to this day. In this video, we take a look at the complex and evergreen moment in French movies, and examine why it has had the lasting impact we see today. Take out your French dictionary.

INTRODUCTION TO FRENCH NEW WAVE

The French New Wave, which emerged in the late 1950s and peaked in the early 1960s, revolutionized cinema by largely rejecting the polished conventions of traditional studio filmmaking. Directors like Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, and Agnes Varda (Cleo From 9 to 7) favored handheld cameras, natural lighting, and jump cuts. Their films were often shot on location using minimal crews and non-professional actors, lending a raw, spontaneous feel which evoked the Italian Neorealists. At the same time, they borrowed from stylized genres like noir to create something audiences had never seen before.

FRENCH NEW WAVE FILMS THEMES

French New Wave filmmakers were deeply influenced by existentialist philosophy and postwar disillusionment. Their characters often struggled with questions of identity, morality, and alienation. Many narratives featured young, disaffected protagonists-- antiheroes navigating an absurd or indifferent world. Films like The 400 Blows (Truffaut) and Breathless (Godard) subverted traditional plot structures or discarded them entirely, replacing them with open-ended narratives that prioritized psychological complexity over neat resolution.

THE LEFT BANK

While many of the most iconic figures of the New Wave were associated with Cahiers du Cinéma, a parallel group of filmmakers emerged known as the “Left Bank.” This loosely defined movement included Agnès Varda, Alain Resnais, and Chris Marker. Often more experimental and politically engaged, Left Bank directors were closely tied to literature and other non-cinema art forms.

INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH NEW WAVE EXPLAINED

The French New Wave has had a profound and lasting impact on cinema. Its techniques, and spirit of rebellion, have inspired filmmakers in the U.S. (Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino) and beyond. The movement helped cement the idea of the “auteur” and redefined what cinema could be: personal, political, poetic. Its legacy lives on in contemporary independent filmmaking, where low budgets and high ambition continue to thrive, as well as even the most mainstream blockbuster. The French New Wave didn’t just change how films looked and felt. It changed how filmmakers thought.

SHOWER SCENE PSYCHO 1960

Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most important filmmakers of the 20th Century, having made countless influential movies that loom large over a span of genres. One of his many achievements is creating the slasher genre with ""Psycho,"" a film unlike anything else in his catalogue. Today, we look at the defining sequence of the film. Let's dive into the making of Psycho shower scene.

BACKGROUND FOR ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S PSYCHO SHOWER SCENE

The infamous shower scene remains one of the most iconic and studied moments in film history. At the time, Hitchcock was already a well-established master of suspense, but Psycho represented a departure. He financed the film himself and kept costs low. Adapted from Robert Bloch’s novel, the film shocked audiences not only with its violence but with its narrative bait-and-switch: the presumed protagonist is killed 45 minutes into the story. The shower scene was central to that shock: Hitchcock’s goal was to devastate audience expectations using suggestion, rhythm, and misdirection more than explicit gore.

BEHIND THE SCENES PSYCHO BODY DOUBLE

Hitchcock storyboard artist Saul Bass (who also designed the film’s title sequence) to meticulously plan each shot. Janet Leigh, playing Marion, had a body double for many of the shots in the shower scene, particularly those involving nudity. Hitchcock was adamant that no shot show nudity or the knife actually piercing flesh, which necessitated careful choreography. To simulate blood, chocolate syrup was used, since it had the right consistency and photographed well in black and white.

MAKING OF PSYCHO SHOWER SCENE

The rapid editing is crucial to the scene, created the illusion of extreme violence without ever showing a fatal blow. Of course, we have to mention the Psycho shower music. Bernard Herrmann’s score, the unforgettable shrieking violins, was critical to the scene’s impact. Originally, Hitchcock intended the scene to play without music, but after hearing Herrmann’s composition, he changed his mind. The stabbing sound was mimicked by a knife plunging into melons. Together, the editing and music formed a cinematic assault that redefined screen violence. We're still seeing the effects of the Psycho shower kill scene today.

HIGH AND LOW MOVIE

There's little disagreement that Akira Kurosawa is one of the most influential filmmakers of all time. When most people think of Kurosawa, they think of his groundbreaking action epics, like Seven Samurai or Ran. But one of Kurosawa's most enduring films is a modernist thriller, vastly different from the period films he is largely known for. Today, we take a look at High and Low, and see why it is quietly one of the most influential movies ever.

HIGH AND LOW FILM ANALYSIS

The screenplay for High and Low, co-written by Kurosawa along with Eijirō Hisaita, Ryūzō Kikushima, and Hideo Oguni, is structurally unique. It divides the narrative into two distinct halves: the first unfolds almost entirely within the confines of Gondo’s hilltop home, while the second becomes a procedural descent into the streets of the city below. This bifurcated structure reflects the film’s title: “high” and “low” not only geographically, but also socioeconomically.

HIGH AND LOW AKIRA KUROSAWA CINEMATOGRAPHY

Kurosawa’s cinematography in High and Low is essential to the film’s impact. The use of the widescreen Tohoscope format is masterful. Kurosawa often fills the frame with multiple characters, using deep focus to emphasize relationships and power dynamics. Light and shadow are carefully controlled: the brightness of the upper house contrasts with the dingy, high-contrast images of the slums below. Kurosawa’s visual storytelling anticipates modern procedural dramas and inspired filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Bong Joon Ho, especially in their depictions of class and crime.

BRILLIANT BLOCKING

Perhaps most remarkable is Kurosawa’s use of blocking (no surprise). The first half of High and Low is a masterclass in spatial choreography. Even the positioning of minor characters in the background contributes to the narrative. In the second half, the blocking becomes more fluid, reflecting the chaos and unpredictability of the manhunt. Kurosawa’s approach to blocking was hugely influential on just about every auteur who followed him, and High and Low is him at the height of his blocking capabilities.

High and Low remains one of cinema’s most meticulous and impactful movies. And it's not even Kurosawa's most famous films.

WHAT IS A ZOOM SHOT?

The zoom shot is a staple of cinema. And yet, it's somewhat controversial. Some filmmakers refuse to zoom, seeing the technique as showy or dated. Others, like Stanley Kubrick or Robert Altman, made a career out of jaw-dropping zooms. So what makes a zoom shot so powerful? And how do great filmmakers use it?

ZOOM LENS PHYSICS

From a technical standpoint, a zoom shot is achieved by adjusting the focal length of a zoom lens while the camera is recording. As the focal length increases, the image appears to magnify, bringing the subject closer in the frame, known as a zoom in. Conversely, decreasing the focal length widens the frame, pushing the subject away, known as a zoom out. Unlike a prime lens, which has a fixed focal length, a zoom lens allows for continuous variation, making it a flexible tool on set. However, zoom lenses typically have more optical elements and are generally heavier and slower than primes. The movement of the zoom can be controlled manually or by motorized systems for smoother motion.

EXAMPLE OF ZOOM SHOTS

There are many types of zoom shots, each serving a different purpose. A slow zoom-in can gradually draw attention to a character or detail, building tension or intimacy. It can even go unnoticed by the viewer, but it subtly alters emotional engagement. A slow zoom-out, on the other hand, can situate a character in their environment, emphasizing loneliness or disconnection. Snap zooms, meanwhile, are more abrupt and attention-grabbing. They're often used for comic effect or stylistic flair. The pacing and direction of the zoom shapes how the audience interprets a moment.

CRAZIEST ZOOM SHOT IN FILM

Creatively, zoom shots can be combined with camera movement to produce visually stunning effects. One of the most famous is the dolly zoom, where the camera moves forward while simultaneously zooming out (or vice versa). This creates a disorienting shift in perspective, where the subject remains the same size in the frame while the background appears to stretch or compress. Zooms can also be paired with pans or tilts, tracking movements, or rack focus transitions. The key to effective use lies in intention: zooming should serve the narrative or emotional tone, not just act as a visual gimmick.

In the hands of a thoughtful filmmaker, the zoom shot can become more than a cheap trick. The power of a zoom lies in your hands— if it feels dated or distracting, rethink how you're using it. A bad carpenter, after all, blames his tools.

DIRECTORS VIEWFINDER

You may not have heard of a director's viewfinder, but if you've been on set or looked at BTS footage, you've likely seen one. True to its name, the director's viewfinder is a handy tool for the leader of a film set. In this video, we take a look at the nifty piece of equipment, and explain why you may want to consider having one the next time you shoot.

LENS FINDER VS. VIEWFINDER

There are several types of director’s viewfinders in use today, each suited to different needs and preferences. The most traditional type is the optical viewfinder, a small handheld device that simulates various focal lengths and aspect ratios. These are quick to use and lightweight.

More advanced lens finders allow filmmakers to mount actual lenses onto the device. This provides a highly accurate representation of how a particular lens will behave, including depth of field and focus falloff. They may be bulkier, but they are also favored for their precision. In recent years, digital tools have entered the scene as well. Smartphone apps like Artemis Pro have transformed mobile devices into powerful digital viewfinders. 

WHY USE A DIRECTOR VIEWFINDER

The value of a viewfinder extends far beyond convenience. Its primary use is enabling directors to plan shots before the camera is in place. By pre-visualizing compositions, filmmakers can decide on lens choices, block actors, and determine where the camera should move, all without needing to reposition the actual gear. They allow the director and cinematographer to test perspectives, assess background elements, and anticipate lighting challenges. 

HOW TO USE A DIRECTOR'S VIEWFINDER

Using a viewfinder is relatively straightforward. The filmmaker must first set the appropriate aspect ratio and sensor size to match the intended camera setup. Then, by cycling through different focal lengths or attaching real lenses, they can explore how each one frames the subject.

THE POOR THINGS LENS

A specter is haunting Hollywood– the specter of Petzval. If you're a fan of arthouse film, you've likely noticed that in recent years, filmmakers have started favoring a shot which creates a strange, swirling bokeh. This isn't something built with visual effects. In fact, it's the result of a Petzval lens: a piece of glass nearly two centuries old. In this episode, we take a look at why the lens is so popular, and how filmmakers can use it.

WHAT IS A PETZVAL LENS?

The Petzval lens was created in 1840 by Hungarian mathematician Joseph Petzval. Originally developed for portrait photography, it was one of the first lenses engineered specifically for use with cameras rather than being adapted from telescope optics. The Petzval design is characterized by its fast (for the time) aperture, which allowed for shorter exposure times in an era when most photography required several minutes. Its unique build is a direct result of the lens’s field curvature and uncorrected optical aberrations, which for a long time were considered flaws. Today, however, is a different story.

HOW TO ACHIEVE THE PETZVAL EFFECT

Using a Petzval lens requires a bit of a different technique than modern glass. Many of the contemporary Petzval-style lenses, like those produced by Lomography, are manual focus. This makes exposure and focusing a more tactile and deliberate process. To get the best results, cinematographers typically use Petzval lenses for subjects where the center of the frame contains the main focus.

LOMOGRAPHY PETZVAL POPULARITY

In a digital age dominated by ultra-sharp lenses, the Petzval lens stands out as a creative tool that offers something different. Filmmakers alike are drawn to its unmistakable aesthetic– a combination of central sharpness and peripheral smear that gives images a romantic, almost painterly quality. The imperfections that would once have been design limitations are now seen as artistic assets, providing character that’s hard to replicate with digital filters alone.

TESTING MOVIES

If you were to ask filmmakers what step of the movie process is the most painful, the lion's share of them would likely say test screenings. And yet, the practice of test screenings is deeply embedded into the film industry. Do test screenings really ruin movies? Or is there some use in the torturous process? We break down how test screenings work, and the pros and cons to the controversial technique.

HOW DO TEST SCREENINGS WORK?

So what actually goes on during a preview screening? Test screenings are a tool used by filmmakers and studios to gauge audience reactions to a film before its official release. Typically, these screenings involve presenting a rough cut of the movie to a selected audience. After the screening, viewers are often asked to complete surveys, participate in interviews, or join focus groups to provide feedback on various elements of the film. This feedback is then analyzed by producers, filmmakers, and marketing teams to determine whether changes should be made.

ARE MOVIE TEST SCREENINGS GOOD?

The most obvious benefit of test screenings is the opportunity to view the film through the eyes of an objective audience. Audience reactions can highlight issues that may not have been apparent during production. But there is also something about watching with an audience that makes a filmmaker themselves see the movie differently– they can feel what's working and what's not. Test screenings can also guide marketing strategies by identifying which characters, themes, or scenes resonate most strongly with viewers.

ARE PREVIEW SCREENINGS BAD?

Test screenings are not without drawbacks. There's a risk that creative decisions will be compromised in an attempt to please a broad audience, diluting the filmmaker’s original vision. Studios often overreact to negative feedback, pushing for changes that result in a more conventional or less daring final product. As a result, many filmmakers argue that test screenings can hinder rather than help the artistic integrity of a film.

So there's far from a consensus on test screenings. So maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle. Don't blindly embrace them, but maybe don't totally discount them either.

AUTEUR THEORY IN FILM STUDIES

If you've taken any film theory or film studies course, at just about any level, you've likely heard of the Auteur Theory. As controversial as it is ubiquitous, the Auteur Theory helped film get taken more seriously as an art form while also acting as a gatekeeping influence over who gets to be considered a true ""auteur"" filmmaker. Thus the debate rages on and on: is the theory legitimate and necessary, overly simplistic and over-rated, nefarious and exclusionary, or all of the above? We dive into all of it.

WHAT IS AUTEUR THEORY

Auteur theory is a critical framework in film studies that emphasizes the director as the primary creative force behind a film. Originating from French film criticism in the 1950s, particularly through the writings of François Truffaut and the critics of Cahiers du Cinéma, the theory argues that the director’s vision, style, and thematic concerns shape a film in ways that elevate them to the status of an ""author"" or auteur. Auteur theory gained significant traction in the 1960s, especially through the work of critic Andrew Sarris, who articulated a more formal structure for identifying auteurs.

AUTEUR THEORY EXPLAINED

The first criterion for auteur status is technical competence. This refers to the director’s mastery over the medium’s formal elements: an auteur must demonstrate a consistent ability to craft films that exhibit professional command of these tools. Competence establishes credibility. It's what allows a director’s deeper artistic personality to emerge. Without technical proficiency, a director is just, well, not able to make good movies.

AUTEUR THEORY BREAKDOWN

Arguably the most important aspect of auteur theory is the presence of a distinguishable personality or stylistic signature that appears consistently across a director’s body of work. The auteur's personality becomes a lens through which their films can be interpreted, linking disparate works into a coherent artistic trajectory. This personal imprint separates auteurs from directors who merely execute a screenplay or fulfill studio requirements without embedding their own creative voice.

AUTEUR THEORY IN FILM CRITICISM

Perhaps the most elusive element of auteur theory is what Sarris referred to as ""interior meaning."" This is the thematic depth that emerges from the tension between the director's personal vision and the constraints of the film medium. Interior meaning elevates a technically proficient and stylistically consistent director into the realm of the auteur by suggesting a profound engagement with ideas. But for critics of the theory, this pillar of auteurism is vague and essentially meaningless.

WHAT MAKES A24 SO GOOD?

It's the question everyone has been asking for over a decade now. A24 is on a hot streak that is the envy of Hollywood. But is A24 really that different from the competition? What really makes A24 special? The answer may surprise you (hint: it's not really the movies). Let's dig into the mystique that is A24.

A24 FILM STUDIO?

A24 is an independent entertainment company that has made a name for itself by distributing, producing, and financing some of the most distinctive films of the past decade. Founded in 2012, A24 started primarily as a distributor, bringing under-the-radar films to wider audiences. That's right: it didn't actually make the movies. But over time, it expanded into production, financing, and even TV. Unlike major studios that often chase blockbuster returns, A24 focuses on artist-driven, genre-defying films that may not appeal to mass audiences but earn deep loyalty from cinephiles.

A24 MOVIES MARKETING

A24's marketing strategy is anything but traditional, and that’s arguably the biggest part of its success. Instead of relying on massive ad budgets, A24 often leans into internet culture and niche communities. Their trailers, posters, and social media campaigns tend to be cryptic, stylish, and minimalist, creating intrigue rather than explaining the entire film.

On top of that, A24 understands how to build a brand identity: when audiences see the A24 logo, they associate it with quality. The company has encouraged this by creating merchandise and physical media releases that tap into the collector culture. Rather than selling a movie, A24 sells an aesthetic.

WHY ARE A24 MOVIES SO GOOD?

Perhaps the most defining trait of A24’s success is its deep respect for filmmakers. In an industry where studios often dilute vision in favor of marketability, A24 stands out by giving directors real creative freedom. This has attracted a range of innovative voices, from Barry Jenkins to Ari Aster, Greta Gerwig to Robert Eggers. This philosophy has led to films that feel fresh and emotionally resonant.

Where A24 goes from here is anything but obvious. It's not the first hot indie studio, and most hot indie studios eventually collapse. Combine that with an astronomical valuation from private equity folks, and you've got a company that is going to be pressured to expand and find more revenue. That's not always a recipe for success.

STUDIOBINDER + FILM SCHOOL

At Pepperdine University, Professor Jacob Michael explains how the introduction of StudioBinder's production management software has enhanced his curriculum and empowered his students' filmmaking process.

As Prof. Michael says, he was looking for film education software that could facilitate his lectures on the logistical and creative filmmaking procedures, and would also give his students real-world experience with how those processes are done. He found what he was looking for in StudioBinder. Now, for example, instead of just learning about how script breakdowns are done, his students could do it for themselves.

Another aspect Prof. Michael and his students highlight relates to collaboration. Filmmaking, as we know, is a collaborative effort so having an entire crew connected in a single program is ideal. The students also found the benefits of not relying on multiple programs and separate accounts to keep themselves organized. Shot lists, storyboards, location management, call sheets, scripts, breakdown reports — everything in StudioBinder is centralized, shareable, and integrated.

We would like to thank Prof. Michael and his students for sharing their thoughts on using StudioBinder in their work.

NIGHT OF THE HUNTER MOVIE

Charles Laughton only made one movie. But that single film has had the resonance of many directors' entire careers. ""Night of the Hunter"" is a terrifying classic, even though it was a critical and commercial bomb when it was released, and was subsequently forgotten for years. Today, the film is regarded as one of the all-time greats. What about the Robert Mitchum masterpiece is so influential? Why do filmmakers return to it again and again?

NIGHT OF THE HUNTER ANALYSIS

The film’s story, adapted from the Davis Grubb novel of the same name, centers on a pair of children fleeing from a murderous preacher, Harry Powell, who is after a hidden stash of money. The narrative stands out for its dark fairy-tale tone: it's simple on the surface, yet filled with moral and ethical examinations. The tale becomes an allegory of innocence versus corruption, with children navigating a world where adults cannot be trusted.

NIGHT OF THE HUNTER CINEMATOGRAPHY

Stanley Cortez’s cinematography in ""The Night of the Hunter"" is probably its most iconic legacy. The Orson Welles collaborator employed stark black-and-white contrasts, deep shadows, and angular compositions to evoke a German Expressionist aesthetic. The use of light and shadow became a template for countless thrillers and horror films. Iconic shots like the underwater image of the murdered mother in a car have been endlessly referenced.

ROBERT MITCHUM PERFORMANCE

Robert Mitchum’s portrayal of the Preacher is chillingly charismatic and continues to define the archetype of the charming psychopath who is the embodiment of evil. Actors like Anthony Hopkins, Javier Bardem, and Robert Englund clearly have borrowed from Mitchum when crafting similarly sinister characters.

""Night of the Hunter"" may not have been a smash hit, and may even have ended the career of its director, but its legacy is nearly unmatched. If you haven't seen this movie– right that wrong!

CHIVO'S CINEMATOGRAPHY STYLE

Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the most celebrated cinematographers of the 21st century. He is behind the cinematography of ""The Tree of Life,"" ""Children of Men,"" ""Birdman,"" ""The Revenant,"" and many other eye-popping works. What makes Chivo's cinematography style so distinct and impactful? In this video, we dive into the signature Lubezki look, how it's achieved, and what we can learn from it.

EMMANUEL LUBESKI LIGHTING

Lubezki is perhaps best known for his use of natural light. Having come to reject the heavily stylized lighting setups common in Hollywood, Lubezki prefers the realism and unpredictability of available light sources. This choice places characters physically and emotionally within the world they inhabit, making the cinematography feel organic rather than artificial.

CHIVO CAMERA MOVEMENT

Lubezki’s camera is almost always in motion, creating a sense of fluidity and improvisation. He often uses long, unbroken takes to immerse the viewer in the characters' experiences. This approach requires incredible coordination between the camera, lighting, and actors. It's important to note that Lubezki uses movement not merely as a visual trick but as a storytelling tool.

CHIVO CINEMATOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT

Lubezki’s technical choices have evolved over his career, reflecting both advancements in technology and his pursuit of naturalism after the 1990s. Initially shooting on film, he later transitioned to digital formats since they allowed greater flexibility in low-light conditions and longer takes. Lubezki also favors wide-angle lenses. These lenses exaggerate perspective and create a sense of intimacy, especially in handheld or Steadicam shots (which he's a big fan of). The wide field of view allows the audience to observe characters within their full environment.

Looking at his body of work, it's no wonder why Chivo is one of the most revered living cinematographers. His style is both inimitable and consistently in service of the story he's telling. That's pretty much the idea DP.

ANORA BEHIND THE SCENES

Sean Baker has been an indie darling for about two decades, but with ""Anora,"" the scrappy filmmaker ascended to new levels of acclaim. His film has collected awards like baseball cards, and broke records at the Oscars. But what makes this movie so special? We think the answer to that question lies in the movie's crown jewel: a 30 minute scene smack dab in the middle of its runtime. The sequence encapsulates the core theme of the film (kinds of power and how its used) and its unique tone.

ANORA SCENE BREAKDOWN

In the screenplay, the home invasion scene is meticulously crafted to balance tension and dark humor. Ani confronts enforcers sent by her husband Ivan's family to annul their marriage. The dialogue oscillates between absurdity and gravity, reflecting Ani's resilience against the intruders' incompetence.

ANORA DIRECTING BLOCKING

The physical arrangement of actors and their movements within the scene contribute significantly to its portrayal of power dynamics. Ani's defiance is highlighted through her strategic positioning and actions, such as using household items to fend off the intruders.

ANORA CINEMATOGRAPHY

Director of Photography Drew Daniels employs a dynamic visual style to mirror the scene's escalating chaos. The sequence begins with composed, formal shots that gradually transition into frenetic handheld camera work as tensions rise. This deliberate shift enhances the audience's immersion into the turmoil once Toros arrives.

ANORA EDITING AND SOUND DESIGN

The editing rhythmically balances moments of high tension with brief respites, allowing viewers to process the unfolding events. Sound also plays a crucial role in amplifying the scene's emotional impact. There is no music, only overlapping dialogue and dramatic sound effects to punctuate chaotic moments. When there are brief respites, silence allows us to collect ourselves.

""Anora"" shows Sean Baker ascending to a new level. We can't wait to see where he goes next.

SPLIT DIOPTERS EXPLAINED

There are few shots as fun as the split diopter shot. Pulling it off involves careful choreography, framing, focus, lighting, mise en scene, and more. But the trick shot is more than a flex for other DPs and directors to admire. In this video, we dive into all things split diopter, from its uses to some classic examples.

HOW TO USE A SPLIT DIOPTER

A split diopter is a half-convex lens attachment that allows two subjects at different depths to remain in focus simultaneously. Unlike deep focus cinematography, which requires stopping down the aperture, increasing light levels, and sacrificing background blur, a split diopter creates two separate focal planes in a single frame.

To set up a split diopter shot, the first step is determining the composition. The cinematographer needs to position one subject in the foreground and another in the background. Once the shot is framed, the split diopter is mounted onto the camera lens, typically using a matte box.

Focusing with a split diopter requires a careful balance. The cinematographer usually will first focus on the subject without the diopter, hen fine-tunes the focus until the second subject also appears sharp. Since split diopters do not increase the depth of field but rather create an artificial division, a soft blur line will appear between the two focal planes. You can minimize this distraction with mise en scene choices.

BEST SPLIT DIOPTER SHOTS

Split diopters are commonly used when filmmakers need to emphasize two distinct elements in the same frame without losing clarity. Thrillers benefit greatly from this technique, allowing tension to build between a foreground character and an ominous background element. Directors can use split diopters for stylistic reasons, enhancing their compositions with exaggerated depth and distinct focal separations.

CREATIVE SPLIT DIOPTER FX

Some cinematographers may experiment with removing the diopter mid-shot, requiring a lot of practice and patience. Meanwhile, there are variations on the split diopter. Spot diopters, for example, isolate a single circular area in focus while the rest remains blurred. This effect draws attention to a specific detail without disrupting the overall depth of field.

For a while, split diopters were out of fashion, but they're making a comeback. It's a welcome change-- the tool harkens back to iconoclastic directors like Brian DePalma.

HOW WILL AI RESHAPE THE FUTURE OF THE FILM INDUSTRY?

The robots are coming! Or rather, the robots are here. What does the dawn of the AI age mean for filmmakers? That's anyone's guess. But what's not a question mark is that AI will change filmmaking-- it already has. In this video, we look at how it's changing the industry, and why it's being met with so much hesitation and derision.

PRE-PRODUCTION AI FILMMAKING

AI can have a hand in many stages of pre-production, streamlining scriptwriting, budgeting, scheduling, and even casting. Screenwriting tools powered by AI, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Sudowrite, can help generate story ideas, suggest dialogue, and refine scripts based on data from successful films. AI also assists in pre-visualization by generating concept art, storyboards, and even entire virtual environments before a single frame is shot.

AI PRODUCTION

AI has yet to play a huge role in production. It can help to quickly create production design elements, like posters and photos, and, of course, it can create its own footage. But AI still has a long way to go with footage creation, often not providing filmmakers much control. But, hey, in the future anything's possible.

AI POST-PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY

Post-production is where AI truly shines. Editing software powered by AI can analyze hours of footage and help conduct assistant editor duties. AI is also transforming visual effects. It can upscale low-resolution footage, remove backgrounds without green screens, and enhance CGI realism. AI-powered de-aging technology can make actors to appear younger without excessive manual VFX work.

THE DARK SIDE OF AI IN FILMMAKING

But AI isn't all fun and games-- there's good reason for many creatives to be concerned. One of the biggest of these concerns is the potential loss of human creativity. While AI can assist in writing and editing, many fear that relying too heavily on algorithms will lead to formulaic and uninspired storytelling.

Ultimately, how AI will affect filmmaking is anyone's guess. Like with any burgeoning technology, it's possibilities may seem endless now, but they could easily come up short of expectations. Or maybe it will be more powerful than anyone could have foreseen.

POST PRODUCTION SOUND FOR FILM

There's an old adage in filmmaking that audiences will forgive bad visuals, but they'll never forgive bad sound. And it's hard to get good sound. Good sound is often resurrected, or created, in post production. The sound process in post is a massive undertaking, and is crucially important. In this video, we look at everything you need to know to achieve good sound.

MOVIE SOUND TERMS

Several tools are used in post-production sound to refine and enhance audio quality. Equalization (commonly known as EQ) adjusts frequency levels to balance tones and remove unwanted noise. Compression manages dynamic range, making quieter sounds louder and reducing peaks. 

SOUND EDITING

Supervising sound editors oversee the entire process, coordinating teams and ensuring quality control. Sound designers organize and refine audio elements, ensuring dialogue, sound effects, and music align seamlessly with the visuals. Dialogue editors clean up and sync recorded speech, while ADR editors oversee rerecorded dialogue integration.

POST SOUND EFFECTS

Sound effects enhance realism or heighten dramatic impact in a film. Foley artists create and record everyday sounds such as footsteps, rustling clothes, or object interactions. Field recordists capture ambient noises and environmental sounds on location. 

POST PRODUCTION MUSIC

We all know how important music is. Composers write original scores, tailoring melodies to enhance mood and story beats. Music supervisors select and license pre-existing tracks to complement scenes. Orchestrators arrange compositions for live performances, ensuring the right instrumentation. 

SOUND MIXING

And finally, the final step. Sound mixing involves balancing all audio elements to create a cohesive and immersive experience.  The final mix determines how audiences perceive and engage with the film’s soundscape, making it one of the most critical (and difficult) steps in post-production audio.

LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING EPISODE 3

Often, the difference in perceived production value of a movie comes down to post-production. A film that gets careful and professional attention in the final stage of movie making will always look better than a movie that rushes through the stage. In our last episode of Low Budget Filmmaking, we look at post-production: how to do it for cheap, and how to do it well.

LOW BUDGET EDITING

Editing is the backbone of post-production, shaping raw footage into a coherent, engaging narrative. For low-budget filmmakers, cost-effective solutions are essential. A low-budget editor often wears multiple hats, and is often the filmmaker themselves. If you know how to edit, you'll likely want to do it yourself. Alternatively, find someone who is passionate about the project, not just looking for a paycheck.

FINISHING IN NO BUDGET FILMMAKING

Sound and color are crucial to a polished final product. Sound and color are crucial to a polished final product. In low-budget productions, audio issues are common, but they can often be fixed in post. Free sound effects libraries provide high-quality audio elements to enhance production value without additional cost. If it's possible, hiring a freelance sound mixer for final mastering will significantly elevate quality.

For visuals, color correction and grading will likely be resource-intensive, but one budget-friendly solution is embracing black and white. By removing color from the equation, filmmakers can focus on contrast, lighting, and composition to create a timeless, artistic aesthetic. 

LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING MARKETING HACKS

Once the film is complete, marketing and distribution strategies determine its reach. With limited funds, leveraging social media is the most effective way to build an audience. Creating behind-the-scenes content, trailers, and promotional stills generates interest. Submitting to indie film festivals can provide exposure and networking opportunities. A strategic approach to marketing and distribution ensures that even a low-budget film can find its audience and gain traction in the industry.

When you've wrapped production, you can't rest on your laurels. Post-production will make or break your chances at releasing a professional-looking movie into the world.

FOLLOWING FILM ANALYSIS

Few would dispute that Christopher Nolan is one of the most successful directors of the 21st century, if not of all time. The British filmmaker has helmed massive blockbusters that are beloved by audiences and critics alike. But to really understand how Christopher Nolan works, you need to look at how he started. His first feature, Following, was made for $6,000, but it immediately established that he was a filmmaker to watch. In this video, we lay out why Following works so well, and what lessons beginning filmmakers can take from it.

CHRISTOPHER NOLAN FILM SCHOOL

Nolan never attended a formal film school, and Following showcases the lessons he learned through hands-on experience. Nolan developed his craft by studying films on his own, experimenting with Super 8 cameras as a teenager, and absorbing film theory from books. The film’s stripped-down nature— shot on weekends with a small cast and crew— proves that passion, discipline, and strategic planning can be just as valuable as a degree.

CHRISTOPHER NOLAN DIRECTING SHORTS

Before Following, Nolan honed his skills through short films. Shorts allowed him to experiment with themes and techniques he would later refine in Following and beyond. Many of the hallmarks of his later work— nonlinear storytelling, unreliable narrators— are present in Following. Aspiring filmmakers can take inspiration from this: short films provide a training ground to test techniques, build confidence, and prepare for larger projects.

FOLLOWING 1998 EMBRACES LIMITATIONS

With almost no budget to speak of, Nolan had to be creative. He used natural light, available locations, and non-professional actors. The film’s black-and-white aesthetic, dictated by budgetary constraints, ultimately enhances its noir atmosphere. Rather than seeing limitations as obstacles, Nolan used them to his advantage. Following demonstrates how limitations can force a filmmaker to be inventive, resourceful, and efficient.

NOLAN'S FOLLOWING WAS STEP ONE

Following wasn’t just a one-off personal project— it was a strategic step forward. Nolan used the film to showcase his abilities, gaining recognition on the festival circuit and attracting interest in his next film, Memento, the script for which he had already written. The lesson here is that a first feature can be a calling card, proving to producers and investors that a filmmaker has vision, discipline, and the ability to execute a compelling story. But if you're not ready for the next step, this calling card can be a waste.

JOHN CARPENTER MOVIES EXPLAINED

When most people are asked to name some of the greatest directors of the 20th century, there are the usual suspects: Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick. But ask any horror fan worth their salt the same question, and they're more than likely to answer with one name: John Carpenter. Carpenter has been dubbed the Master of Horror for good reason, having created some of the most iconic horror movies of all time, from The Thing to The Fog to none other than Halloween. In our video, we analyze Carpenter's work to understand how his films are so affecting.

JOHN CARPENTER STORY ANALYSIS

Carpenter crafts high-concept, minimalist narratives often focused on a group of people trapped in a single space. His stories typically comment on society. They Live, for example, is a satirical takedown of Reaganomics.

JOHN CARPENTER PRODUCTION DESIGN

Carpenter's films maximize limited budgets with streamlined, iconic sets that create a strong sense of place. He often uses the familiar to heighten horror— this could happen to you too.

JOHN CARPENTER CINEMATOGRAPHY

Carpenter’s visual style is minimalistic, relying on anamorphic widescreen compositions, deep focus, and fluid camera movements. Suspense builds through slow, deliberate shots, with strategic use of shadows, negative space, and background elements to create unease.

JOHN CARPENTER EDITING

Like with his cinematography, Carpenter's editing is often minimal and not showy. His methodical editing emphasizes tension over rapid cutting. Extended sequences allow the audience to anticipate danger before characters do, heightening suspense.

JOHN CARPENTER MOVIES SOUND DESIGN

Carpenter’s use of sound is crucial to atmosphere. Eerie ambient noise, heavy breathing, and unsettling silences amplify fear. Quiet moments are used effectively, making sudden sounds more jarring and immersive.

JOHN CARPENTER MUSIC

Carpenter's music is, quite simply, iconic. Self-composed synth scores feature repetitive, pulsating rhythms that enhance tension and mood. Minimalist yet atmospheric, his music plays a key role in pacing, reinforcing suspense, and defining his films' distinctive tone.

John Carpenter has always been a Hollywood outsider. But if you love horror, you love the curmudgeon.

FILMMAKING LOW BUDGET

Often, the hardest thing about filmmaking is getting the money to make a film. So if you've gotten that far, pat yourself on the back. But you're not done yet. Now you actually have to shoot the thing, and shooting a movie on a low budget can be a Herculean task. In our second episode of Low Budget Filmmaking, we dive into some ways to make the productions stage more cost-effective.

LOCATION BUDGET FILMMAKING SETUP

Securing locations is one of the biggest challenges in low-budget filmmaking. Renting professional sets or shutting down city streets is often too expensive, so filmmakers have to think strategically. Many low-budget movies use free or low-cost locations like public parks, friends’ homes, or small businesses willing to offer space in exchange for exposure. To avoid permits and fees, you can shoot guerrilla. Some filmmakers write scripts specifically around locations they already have access to, ensuring the story fits within their budget constraints.

Another approach is to use a single location for the majority of the film. Shooting in controlled environments minimizes travel and logistical issues. When scouting, a filmmaker can think about how a single location can be dressed or repurposed to look like multiple settings, maximizing variety without additional costs.

LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING EQUIPMENT IDEAS

Expensive cameras and rigs are out of reach for most low-budget productions, but, luckily, today’s technology makes high-quality filmmaking more accessible than ever. Many indie films are shot on DSLRs, mirrorless cameras, or even smartphones. Be creative when sourcing equipment, ask film schools or local production groups.

Lighting is another crucial factor, but professional lights can be costly. DIY lighting setups — like using practical lights, affordable LED panels, or bouncing natural light with reflectors — can create professional-looking results at a fraction of the cost.

CINEMATIC LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING CINEMATOGRAPHY

The way a film is shot greatly affects its perceived production value. With the right cinematography techniques, even low-budget films can look polished and professional. The key is to lean into your limitations. Instead of trying to mimic expensive camera movements like cranes or Steadicams, use handheld shots for a raw, intimate feel. If stability is needed, use budget-friendly alternatives like tripods, monopods, or shoulder rigs.

Shooting a low budget movie ain't easy. But if you're smart and pay attention to the details, it can be rewarding. We promise.

SPORTS MOVIE CLICHES

There are fewer things more exciting than a good sports movie. We get personally connected to the players and their coach, we root for their success, and we sit on the edge of our seat while we watch them persevere through adversity. We can leave on a high after a feel-good story, or thinking more deeply about what ""winning"" really means. But sports movies often fall victim to some of the most predictable tropes. In this video, we examine common sports movie cliches, and how you can subvert them to make your story more interesting.

THE COACH'S SPEECH

A staple of nearly every sports movie, the coach’s halftime or pre-game speech is designed to rally the team and push them to victory. These speeches are often overly sentimental, packed with inspirational one-liners, and accompanied by swelling music, reaction shots, and a slow push-in. While often effective, they can feel formulaic and unrealistic.

Instead of a typical rousing speech, a coach could deliver a brutally honest, no-frills talk or even stay silent, letting the team find motivation from within. Another approach is a speech that inspires the team in an unexpected way—perhaps the coach shares a personal failure instead of a victory to make a deeper impact.

DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK COACH

From The Mighty Ducks to Hoosiers, the reluctant or disgraced coach who gets a shot at redemption is a familiar trope. This character is often a former athlete who squandered their talent or a once-great coach who fell from grace. Predictably, the team’s success mirrors the coach’s personal growth.

There are a few ways to subvert this trope. Maybe you push it to comedic extremes– the coach's shortcomings are ridiculous rather than devastating. Or you could de-emphasize sports. The coach may be inept at coaching, but they bring the best out of their team outside the sport.

LAST SECOND SHOT

Most sports movies culminate in a climactic moment where the underdog team scores a buzzer-beater, makes an impossible play, or wins in overtime. It’s thrilling, but predictable.

Instead of winning, the team could lose but find victory in personal growth. It's all about the journey, not the destination. Another option is to exaggerate the trope to comedic ends.

By tweaking these clichés, sports movies can keep audiences engaged while still delivering the emotional highs the genre is known for. Time to shoot your shot.

HOW ANDREI TARKOVSKY UNIQUELY MADE FILMS

There are few directors held in higher esteem than Andrei Tarkovsky. The legendary Russian filmmaker only made seven films, but over the course of his career he solidified himself as one of the most important figures in cinema’s history. So what is it about Tarkovsky that makes him so venerated? And what lessons can aspiring filmmakers learn from him?

ANDREI TARKOVSKY STYLE WRITING

Andrei Tarkovsky’s storytelling is deeply philosophical and poetic. His films explore themes of memory, time, and spirituality, often favoring abstract storylines rather than traditional narrative structures. His use of long, contemplative monologues and elliptical narratives invites the audience into a deeply immersive and reflective experience that feels like a visual poem.

ANDREI TARKOVSKY PRODUCTION DESIGN

Tarkovsky’s production design leans toward realism, but with a mystical and decayed quality that gives his films a timeless, almost otherworldly atmosphere. Tarkovsky frequently used natural elements to enhance the poetic and spiritual tone of his settings, making nature itself feel like a character in his films. 

TARKOVSKY ON COLOR

Tarkovsky’s colors are muted, earthy, and organic, creating a painterly quality that enhances the emotional depth of his films. He avoided overly stylized or artificial color schemes, since he saw them as potentially distracting, and instead favored subtle hues that contributed to a dreamlike atmosphere.

ANDREI TARKOVSKY CINEMATOGRAPHY

Tarkovsky’s cinematography is famous for its long takes and fluid, painterly compositions. He often used slow, hypnotic camera movements that followed characters in real-time, allowing scenes to unfold organically. His use of deep focus, emphasizes the connection between characters and their environments, reinforcing his themes of memory and time.

ANDREI TARKOVSKY EDITING

Tarkovsky’s editing style supplemented his shooting style. He cut only when absolutely necessary. He called editing ""sculpting in time,"" encouraging the audience to absorb each moment fully. Rather than relying on quick cuts or montage, Tarkovsky’s edits create a fluid progression that mirrors the workings of memory and thought.

TARKOVSKY SOUND DESIGN

Tarkovsky’s approach to sound design was sparse. He blended natural sounds into his films to create an almost hypnotic experience. Silence is also a crucial part of his sound design, emphasizing moments of introspection and deep emotion.

Music in Tarkovsky’s films is equally sparse, and often very atmospheric. He often employed classical compositions, and his music is rarely used as a manipulative emotional cue but rather as an extension of the film’s meditative rhythm.

Understanding Tarkovsky’s style can get us one step closer to emulating him. But there will always only be one Andrei Tarkovsky.

WRITING PROLOGUES

Probably one of the most common pieces of advice a writer gets is to not waste any time starting your story. A prologue flies in the face of that advice, by definition delaying a story's start. So what good is a prologue? In this video, we look at why you may want to use a prologue. If you're prologue isn't serving any of these purposes, then you may want to rethink its necessity.

WORLD BUILDING PROLOGUE TIPS

Prologues are instrumental in constructing the world of the film, particularly stories set in unfamiliar or complex environments. They allow filmmakers to establish the rules, history, or geography of the setting without overwhelming the audience later. By presenting key details early, the prologue immerses the audience in the story’s universe, creating a sense of place and context. This can be done through visuals, narration, or titles.

ON WRITING PROLOGUES FOR CHARACTER

A prologue can be a stellar way to introduce key characters. It can include their backstory, motivations, or defining traits that will shape their journey in the film. By providing insight into a character’s past (or present), the prologue establishes an emotional connection between the audience and the character. It doesn't have to be the protagonist– often, films will use a prologue to introduce a particularly intimidating antagonist so we know what is coming down the line.

TONE SETTING PROLOGUES IN FILM

Setting the tone is a critical aspect of any prologue. A prologue can quickly communicate the film’s emotional and stylistic direction, preparing the audience for the journey ahead. A well-crafted prologue establishes the mood and aligns audience expectations with the filmmaker's intent. It can also set the thematic stage, hinting at the overarching ideas the film may be wrestling with.

Ignore the neigh-sayers: prologues are a versatile and powerful storytelling tool in cinema. Whether it be through world-building, character introduction, or tone-setting, they can provide a compelling entry point into the narrative. When executed effectively, they draw the audience in, ensuring they are fully immersed and ready to engage with the story when it at last unfolds.

CINEMATIC LIGHTING TECHNIQUES

When we think of great, cinematic lighting, we often think of elaborate set ups with massive lights and a huge crew. Some great lighting requires a lot of equipment, but not all. With a bounce board, you can use existing light to your advantage at a minuscule cost. In this video, we look at what a bounce board is, why it's used, and how you can use it on your next set.

WHAT IS A BOUNCE BOARD IN FILM

A bounce board, also known as a reflector, is a flat, firm surface used to redirect light. By bouncing and diffusing existing light, it provides control without the need for additional sources. This makes it an invaluable tool for enhancing natural light and creating balanced visuals.

WHY TO USE A BOUNCE BOARD ON SET

Bounce boards are extremely effective at producing soft, even lighting. The larger the board, the softer the effect, making it ideal for reducing harsh contrasts and lightening shadows on a subject. They're especially valuable in outdoor settings, where sunlight can be unpredictable, and in tight spaces where additional lighting equipment might be impractical.

A common application is in booklighting, a technique where light is bounced off a surface and then diffused further, creating a soft glow.

TYPES OF REFLECTORS OR BOUNCE BOARDS

Different types of bounce boards offer varied effects, each suited to specific needs. White bounce boards are the most common, providing soft, neutral light that doesn’t alter the color temperature. Silver bounce boards are more reflective, creating brighter, cooler light that works well in low-light conditions. Gold bounce boards add a warm tone, which is ideal for matching tungsten lights or enhancing golden-hour scenes.

Sunlight reflectors, which combine silver and gold, balance brightness and warmth. Black bounce boards serve as “negative fill,” removing light to create deeper shadows and stronger contrast. In a pinch, walls, ceilings, or foam boards can act as bounce surfaces, while collapsible reflectors offer a portable alternative, though they are less durable in windy conditions.

HOW TO USE A BOUNCE BOARD

To use a bounce board effectively, start with a simple setup, such as foam core or rigid insulation board reinforced with tape for durability. Typically, 4'x4' boards are mounted on C-stands with duckbill clamps or held by a crew member.

Proper placement is key: test by moving the board in and out of the light, adjusting the angle to maximize reflection. Whether handheld or mounted, maintaining consistent positioning ensures your subject is evenly lit. With practice, a bounce board can transform your lighting setup, providing high-quality results at minimal cost.

LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING HACKS

Most movies that we see are expensive. Like, really expensive. If you don't have tens of millions of dollars lying around, making a feature film can feel out of reach. But in reality, making a movie on a small budget isn't impossible, and in fact has a long history stretching back to the advent of filmmaking. In this series, we're going to look at how to make a low budget movie that looks professional and can stand out among movie with many times its budget. Today's topic: pre-production.

LOW BUDGET FILMMAKING IDEAS

The foundation of any successful low-budget film lies in the script. To maximize your resources, it's usually best to write a story with a limited scope, focusing on a small number of characters and a handful of locations. Minimize special effects, elaborate set pieces, or large crowd scenes that can strain your budget. Write to your strengths. If you know you have access to an eye-popping location, include that location in the script. If you can animate, maybe include an animated sequence. Of course, above all else, prioritize story. In the end, that's all that matters.

FINANCING A LOW BUDGET FILM

Financing a low budget film often requires creative solutions. Traditional methods like securing private investors can be challenging but are worth exploring, especially if you can present a strong pitch and a realistic budget. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo are another option, allowing you to raise money from supporters while building an audience for your film.

NO BUDGET FILMMAKING CREW

When working on a tight budget, it’s essential to keep your crew small. Aim to hire multi-skilled individuals who can handle, and are will to take on, more than one role on set. Many independent filmmakers rely on friends or colleagues who are willing to work for reduced rates or as part of a passion project. While it’s tempting to cut corners, always prioritize safety and professionalism. Customize your crew for what you need.

CASTING FILMMAKING ON A BUDGET

For low-budget films, casting is tricky but massively impactful. If possible, try to attach a known actor, even in a minor role, as this can significantly boost your project’s visibility and marketability. If that’s not feasible, consider using non-actors or lesser-known talents who fit your characters perfectly. Hold auditions or look for local theater actors, as they often bring enthusiasm and flexibility to the project. 

Next, you're ready to film. Stay tuned for our next episode for some budget hacks once the cameras are rolling.

HOW TO WRITE FLASHBACKS

Flashbacks are extremely common in film. With nonlinear editing, a filmmaker can jump back in time whenever they see fit. But if not done with purpose, a flashback can feel cliched or expected. In this video, we look at how screenwriters and directors can use flashbacks to add layers to their story and streamline rather than bloat their narrative.

WRITING FLASHBACKS THAT WORK

A flashback should feel indispensable, not arbitrary. Introduce a compelling mystery, emotional tension, or unanswered question in the main narrative. By grounding the flashback in the present-day story, you can enrich the narrative rather than distract from it.

WRITING FLASHBACKS ARCS

Like with any scene, a flashback needs its own mini-arc. It should begin with a setup, escalate through conflict or tension, and conclude with a resolution (or revelation). This structure ensures the flashback is engaging and purposeful.

STRUCTURAL SCREENWRITING TECHNIQUES

Integrating flashbacks seamlessly into a film’s structure is crucial. Decide whether the flashback is a one-off scene or a recurring device. Avoid overloading the story with flashbacks that disrupt the narrative flow– each one should serve a specific purpose. You can slow a narrative down with a flashback, or ratchet up tension.

HOW TO WRITE A BACKSTORY

Flashbacks can add depth to characters by revealing formative experiences, motivations, or vulnerabilities. For instance, showing a character’s strained relationship with a parent can explain their present-day emotional guardedness. But this type of flashback is incredibly common, so it is easy to fall into a trope if you're not careful. Make sure your character flashback feels original, deserved, and true to your story.

WRITING A FLASHBACK TO CHANGE AUDIENCE PERSPECTIVE

A well-timed flashback can reshape how the audience views a character or event. Perhaps a villain’s flashback reveals a moment of profound betrayal, inviting sympathy. These types of flashbacks are often used in movies with twists.

SCREENPLAY FLASHBACKS FOR THEMES

Flashbacks can reinforce a film’s themes by mirroring events or emotions in the present. Use your flashback as an opportunity to show your thematic concerns in a new context. This can strengthen your film's point of view, and add complexity to the themes you are interrogating.

Just because flashbacks are common doesn't mean they need to feel obvious. By thoughtfully employing flashbacks, filmmakers can add layers of tension, emotion, and meaning to their stories.

IS TOM CRUISE GETTING COAL FOR CHRISTMAS?

We here at StudioBinder like to have fun, but for this year's Christmas video we're not laughing. Using a rigid formal analysis, we dissect Kubrick's final masterpiece through the empirical lens of Santa Clause's naughty or nice list. After analyzing hundreds of thousands of micro-decisions and interviewing countless experts in the field, we get to the bottom of the central question in Eyes Wide Shut: would Bill Harford get coal for Christmas?

EYES WIDE SHUT EXPLAINED

Stanley Kubrick wrestled over how to approach Eyes Wide Shut for years. Watching the final product, it is clear that Kubrick's final film has one primary concern: the yuletide dichotomy of naughty and nice. What makes a person naughty? What makes them nice? These philosophical debates, as old as Kris Kringle himself, have led some of the greatest minds in human history into logical quagmires from which there is seemingly no escape (see Nietzsche, Kant). Kubrick deftly avoids providing a clear answer, but using state-of-the-art tools and time-tested methodologies, StudioBinder has solved the quandary as it relates to Bill Harford.

THE DEFINITIVE EYES WIDE SHUT INTERPRETATION

Taking a Hegelian dialectical approach to the material, we find that the protagonist of Eyes Wide Shut exists at the synthesis of the ""Nice"" thesis and ""Naughty"" antithesis. This conclusion was arrived at through a frame-by-frame analysis that was run through an advanced AI software developed for the project by feeding it millions of naughty and nice scenarios.

We hope you enjoy our video, which cost nearly $25 million to produce. It's a small price to pay for an answer to the question which has loomed over generations.

Breaking down a script is a foundational process in pre-production. The old-fashioned method with colored markers tagging elements by hand still works but it doesn't have to be that hard. StudioBinder allows the breakdown process to be quick and collaborative. And because the software is fully integrated, all the work that goes into the breakdown is also applied throughout the project.

It all starts by importing the script and tagging the various elements, creating lists for props, costumes, special effects, and more. You can use our pre-set element categories but you can also create custom element types for a more personal and thorough breakdown. Typically, the 1st AD will do the script breakdown but it's a good idea to let the different departments do their own. That way, the entire production team has a complete and holistic plan for the project needs.

But the collaboration doesn't end there. Team members can comment directly on the breakdown for centralized and collective communication. Or you can send view-only links to anyone outside the core team for additional feedback. Each scene in the breakdown has a notes section to clarify the vision or add reference images and videos.

And a full set of pre-production reports can then be generated, including the Shooting Schedule, DOOD report, and Element lists.

With this level of detail and preparation, you've got a head start on a successful and efficient production.

BLOOD SQUIB CINEMA

In real life, violence is never fun. But in movies, violence can be a blast. For over a century, filmmakers have innovated different ways to revel in the gore, and audiences have eaten it up. One of the pillars of this gore is the squib, a small device that has had a massive impact on the way violence appears on screen.

THE SQUIB EFFECT

Squibs are small explosive devices used in filmmaking to simulate gunshot wounds. They are typically made of a small packet containing fake blood and a tiny explosive charge and attached to an actor’s body or costume in areas where wounds are expected to appear. They are then triggered remotely, and the squib bursts outward, creating a spray of blood and the illusion of a bullet impact. To ensure safety, they are meticulously controlled by special effects teams. Actors wear padding beneath their costumes, and scenes are choreographed to avoid any accidental injuries once they're activated.

SQUIB IN FILM: A HISTORY

Squibs have been a staple in cinema since the mid-20th century, revolutionizing the way violence was depicted on screen. They gained widespread attention in the 1960s, with films such as The Wild Bunch using them to portray graphic violence. By the 1970s and 1980s, the technique had become a standard, used in classics like RoboCop and The Godfather.

SQUIB VS CGI

In recent years, filmmakers have turned to alternatives for simulating gunshot effects, since squibs can be expensive and time-consuming. CGI is a popular substitute, allowing blood splatters and bullet wounds to be added in post-production. This eliminates the need for explosive devices on set, reducing risks to actors and crew.

Digital effects can also offer greater flexibility for revisions and complex choreography. Another alternative is the use of air pressure rigs, which mimic squib effects without the use of pyrotechnics. These methods are often chosen for budget-conscious productions or when safety is paramount. Many directors, however, still prefer practical squibs for their visceral and tangible nature. There's nothing quite like a squib.

STUDIOBINDER CALL SHEETS

No matter the size or budget, productions need call sheets. Without this essential organizational tool, production logistics can turn into chaos. StudioBinder's call sheet software understands the challenges of modern productions and is designed with modern solutions.

The industry-standard template includes all the details you need, including call times, locations, parking, cast, crew, schedule — everything.

But that's just the beginning.

Make the call sheet your own by customizing the layout (show/hide different information blocks, rearrange the order, etc.). Call sheets can be made as simple or detailed as you like, depending on the project or the recipient. For example, a simplified version can be sent to the cast and a more logistics-heavy version can be sent to the crew.

Call sheets can be shared, amended with comments, and finally approved all in StudioBinder. When they're ready, call sheets are sent via text and email to ensure delivery and visibility.

Once call sheets are sent, the most important thing is getting confirmations. In StudioBinder, each individual call sheet is tracked allowing you to see the status, if it was sent correctly, if it was viewed, and if it was confirmed all on a single dashboard.

A production's efficiency is directly tied to tools like call sheets. Create, send, and confirm with StudioBinder call sheets, and rest assured your logistics and communications will be in order.

SYMBOLISM AND SEMIOTICS IN FILM

All art forms contain symbolism. Sculpture, painting, novels, music-- words, images, and sounds can contain multitudes more than what they are on the surface. So it should come as no surprise that film, too, can be rife with symbolism. In fact, the vast majority of filmmakers use symbolism, whether they know it or not (or admit it or not). In this video, we look at how symbols can manifest in you movie, and how you can use them.

UNDERSTANDING SYMBOLISM TYPES

Symbolism in film comes in many forms. A character can represent a broader idea or theme, such as innocence, corruption, or resilience. For example, a protagonist dressed in white might symbolize purity, while a villain cloaked in black may represent danger or mystery. Locations, too, can convey moods or themes. Objects as symbols are perhaps the most direct, like a key representing freedom or a shattered mirror symbolizing fractured identity. Something as simple as an action can also carry symbolic weight, too.

BASIC SYMBOLISM USES

Symbolism allows filmmakers to communicate layers of meaning without explicit exposition. It can convey larger themes– a film about pollution might use a dying tree as a metaphor for humanity’s disconnect from nature. Symbolism also adds dramatic weight to a narrative. For example, the symbolic use of a storm during a climactic confrontation can heighten tension and mirror the emotional turmoil of the characters, or a child's dress can be used to represent someone's past self that has long gone away.

HOW TO SHOW HIDDEN SYMBOLISM IN YOUR FILM

To incorporate symbolism in your movie, start by identifying your film’s themes. Then decide how subtle or overt the symbol should be. A subtle symbol may resonate more profoundly, while an overt one ensures the message is clear. Then carefully decide where to place the symbol within the narrative. It can be good practice to introduce it at a key moment, allowing its meaning to evolve alongside the story. Repetition can reinforce the symbol’s significance, and act as a call back to previous events and ideas.

By embedding symbols in your movie, you can encourage viewers to connect to your story on an intuitive, even subconscious, level.

A CRUCIAL PIECE OF CAMERA GEAR

As anyone who's dipped their toes into cinematography knows, there's a lot of gear involved in getting a great shot. Sure you can get something good without the perfect lens, the ideal tripod, the adequate camera body, and so on– but it's a lot more difficult. One of the most important pieces of camera gear that often gets forgotten is the matte box. In this video, we look at what a matte box is and why you probably need it.

WHAT IS A MATTE BOX?

A matte box is a piece of camera equipment designed to control unwanted light and manage lens flare. It's a rectangular or square housing that attaches to the front of a camera lens. The matte box often includes adjustable, interchangeable filters and flags that can block light or alter its intensity.

DO I NEED A MATTE BOX?

If you're a professional cinematographer, you probably need a matte box. Here's why. A matte box can protect your image from optical artifacts and allow greater creative flexibility. By using a matte box, filmmakers can block harsh light or direct it away from the lens, ensuring clearer, more vibrant images.

Matte boxes also allow for the use of filters, such as ND filters, polarizers, or graduated filters. The ability to stack filters easily on a matte box offers significantly more versatility than if you're attaching them directly to the lens.

MATTE BOX TUTORIAL

Matte boxes come in different sizes to fit various lens diameters. Some matte boxes are designed for specific lens sizes or allow for quick adjustment with clamp rings.

Second, look for a matte box that offers a flexible filter tray system, especially if you plan to use multiple filters. 

Third, a matte box can add significant weight to your rig, so consider how it will affect your balance and ease of movement. Look for one that is both sturdy and lightweight, especially if you’re shooting handheld or need to carry the gear for extended periods.

Matte boxes don't just make your camera rig look more fancy. They're crucial in getting a great image.

THE PROBLEM WITH MOVIE SEQUELS

Movie sequels have been with us for decades, for better or worse. The general consensus is that ""movie sequels are bad,"" probably from the fact that a majority fail to live up to the success of the original. However, there are plenty of examples of movie sequels that are better than the original. So, what's the secret between good sequels vs. bad sequels? There might not be a definitive answer but there are some elements that sequels often contend with that should be taken into consideration.

PERSONNEL

One area that can have an impact on the success of a sequel is the personnel involved. Did the original director return to (hopefully) recapture the magic? Or has a new director been brought on to take the IP in a new direction? The same can be said for the cast — most of the time, the audience expects the same characters to reprise their roles but that also isn't a guarantee.

PLANNED VS. UNPLANNED

In general, it can be argued that a ""planned"" sequel has an advantage over an ""unplanned"" sequel. The former can designed to leave things open-ended knowing that the questions will be answered in the next installment. Unplanned sequels are typically greenlit after a film becomes a surprise hit. When your film makes a massive profit, the opportunity to repeat that success can be irresistible. But as we've seen over and over, even with the same director, cast, and plot, a sequel's success can be just as elusive as a brand new film.

CONTENT

When approaching a sequel, there is a conundrum in the content — make it too similar to the original and it's boring, make it too new and it fails to give the audience what they wanted to return to. One strategy here is to change genres, like how James Cameron took the sci-fi/horror of Ridley's Scott's Alien and turned the sequel into a sci-fi/action film. But, once again, this is also a risk.

Every movie is a gamble and the debate over good movie sequels vs bad movie sequels promises to be a constant. So, when you're about to either make or watch a sequel, try to keep these elements in mind.

STUDIOBINDER CALL SHEET TRACKER

SENDING CALL SHEETS

Sending call sheets is easy enough but how do you confirm they went through or if the recipient actually confirmed? When call sheets go out, you can confirm that they arrived in the recipient's inbox, which is not always a guarantee. Let's say there's a typo in their email address and it bounces? These are clearly marked so you can fix the error and resend that individual call sheet with a personalized message.

CONFIRMING CALL SHEETS

Once the call sheet reaches the right destination, you can see whether they've viewed the call sheet (or not). View counts are updated automatically so if someone has viewed the call sheet but hasn't confirmed, they might need a reminder. If they've received the call sheet, you can manually confirm right in the app.

Once your recipients have received, viewed, and confirmed, you can rest assured that everyone is due to arrive on set at their specific call times.

WHAT IS A FILM NOIR?

Defining film noir is a bit tricky because it's considered by many to be both a style and a genre. Professor James Naremore summed up the issue nicely in saying ""It has always been easier to recognize a film noir than to define the term."" But despite contention to its classification, most critics agree that film noir can be identified by its pessimistic tone, morally grey themes, and high-contrast visuals that mix light and shadow. In our video essay on film noir, we break down the binding similarities in further detail.

HISTORY OF FILM NOIR

Film noir translates from French as ""dark film."" The term was used by critic Nino Frank in 1946 to describe four Hollywood crime dramas: The Maltese Falcon, Laura, Murder, My Sweet, and Double Indemnity. Frank’s writing gave classification to film noir – but the term wasn’t widely used until decades after its original invocation. Nowadays, film noir is characterized by archetypal characters, high-contrast aesthetics, and complex stories with unhappy endings.

DEFINING FILM NOIR TROPES

Film noirs contain many tropes: including types of characters, like the private detective, the corrupt cop, and the femme fatale; stylistic elements, like stark black and white cinematography and chiaroscuro lighting; and narrative conventions, like unhappy endings, where the antagonist gets caught but the protagonist doesn't get what they want.

FILM NOIR GENRE VS. STYLE DEBATE

There is considerable debate as to whether or not film noir is a ""genre"" or ""style."" Pro-genre critics point to the repetition of plots, settings, characters, and aesthetics as proof that film noir constitutes its own genre. Pro-style critics argue that those elements can, and do, exist separately; in different combinations; and/or in distinct genres altogether. Film noir has also been immortalized by the neo noir movement, which renovated many of its progenitor's tropes through genre mashups and graphic visuals.

HOW TO WRITE A VILLAIN

There are many different ways to write a villain. In this video, we break down three types of villains, with tips and tricks on how writers use them to communicate malevolence and malfeasance.

THE BULLY

The bully is one of the oldest villain archetypes – they're a jerk who uses brawn or beauty to beat down others. The bully is not generally meant to be a sympathetic villain; however, writers can subvert their archetypal characterization by utilizing a redemption arc, in which they have them recognize the error of their ways and go on to protect others. This strategy adds a level of emotional complexity in villains – which is capable of transforming them into unlikely heroes, much like Johnny Lawrence in Cobra Kai.

THE MASTERMIND

If you're wondering ""what makes a great villain?"" look no further than the mastermind. This villain is characterized by their attention to detail and ability to exploit weakness. Keyser Söze from The Usual Suspects is a great example: he orchestrates the strings of the story and masterfully tricks other characters (and the audience). The secret to ""how to write good villains"" lies in the ability to challenge heroes; masterminds do this by confronting them with moral questions and games of life or death.

THE PSYCHOPATH

Crafting villains is no easy task, especially when dealing with mental illness. The psychopath is a villain who lacks empathy and has a penchant for violence. Our villain analysis in this section looks at Hannibal Lecter, who is characterized as a ""pure psychopath"" in The Silence of the Lambs. Our tips for writing villains like Lecter include: considering backstory, immoral actions, and foils. When done well, they can add emotional impact to your villain.

VILLAIN WRITING TIPS

The perfect villain is every writer's dream. They instill fear in the hero/the audience and terrorize the narrative by raising the stakes. If you're hoping to write a great villain, consider the three types we outlined here, and look to the many examples we reference in the video!

WHAT IS A MONOLOGUE?

A monologue is a long speech given by a single character. The term is derived from the greek monos for ""alone"" and logos for ""speech.""

TYPES OF MONOLOGUES

There are many different types of monologue. In this ""how to write a monologue"" video essay, we break down four types: soliloquy, internal monologue, dramatic monologue, and musical monologue.

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE

The internal monologue, or ""inner monologue,"" is a type of monologue in which we're given access to the thoughts and feelings a character is unable or unwilling to express. This technique is used to articulate a character's inner voice, which can give us access to their mental processes; often in real time.

DRAMATIC MONOLOGUE

The dramatic monologue is a type of monologue in which a character's solo speech is externalized to other characters and or the audience. This type of monologue writing is most commonly used in settings with large groups; think conference speeches or locker room rallies. However, it can also be used on small scales to develop intimacy between characters.

SOLILOQUY VS MONOLOGUE

A soliloquy is a type of monologue in which a character gives a speech to themself. A musical soliloquy is a popular subtype of soliloquy in which a character gives a speech to themself through the form of song. 

MUSICAL MONOLOGUE

Musical monologues can take the form of a soliloquy or dramatic monologue; they are only distinguished by their use of melody.

MASAHIRO MORI UNCANNY VALLEY THEORY

In 1970, Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori published the essay Bukimi No Tani (不気味の谷), which translates roughly to ""The Uncanny Valley."" In it, Mori theorized that human-like objects, such as robots, become more appealing the more “real” they look; however, there is a point in which they look “too real” and enter into the uncanny valley.

WHY DOES UNCANNY VALLEY HAPPEN?

The uncanny valley happens because our minds are wired to recognize and empathize with humans – but when something looks human yet lacks the essential subtleties of a real person, our brains register it as wrong. In these cases, humans hyper-fixate on small details that don't reach perfect verisimilitude, such as the rate at which robots blink their eyes, or the speed at which they move their limbs.

THE UNCANNY VALLEY EFFECT IN FILM

The uncanny valley effect is used by filmmakers to creep out the audience. This can be done a myriad of ways; for example: zombie movies feature monsters that appear human at a distance, but become uncanny when we notice their unusual movements. The 2022 film M3GAN featured a doll-like robot that terrified moviegoers; the Megan uncanny valley was most often entered when audiences noticed the character's unnatural facial movements, inhuman eyes, and blood-curdling mannerisms.

UNCANNY VALLEY EXAMPLES

The uncanny valley is a huge topic in robotic research. Companies hoping to create androids that are indistinguishable from humans have to contend with the how the slightest of imperfections can shock (and even repulse) potential customers. CGI artists also struggle with the uncanny valley; for example: the 2019 film Cats received poor reviews largely because its oddly anthropomorphic felines unsettled audiences.

In the years since Mori's inception, the uncanny valley has been studied by countless researchers and academics. Not everybody agrees with Mori's theory; some critics argue that culture, age, and experience significantly alter subjective interpretations of the uncanny valley. Moreso, the uncanny valley is easy to avoid; robotocists and artists can incorporate ""cartoonish"" elements in their work to stop short of entering the uncanny valley. Still, the uncanny valley can be purposefully invoked by anybody hoping to terrify their audience.

WHAT IS A TIME LAPSE?

A time lapse is a technique in which frames are captured at a much slower rate than the rate at which they are displayed. Time lapses are used in both photography and videography to show the passage of time. For example: a time lapse photograph of a busy highway will show cars blend into streaks of colored lights; this static image does not include – but implies – motion. Meanwhile a time lapse video of the same scene will show cars moving through the frame at a rate much faster than they would in reality. 

Time lapses are commonly used in nature documentaries to capture clouds moving, flowers growing, and animals migrating; however they can also be found in other visual mediums, such as games, movies, and TV.

HOW DO TIMELAPSES WORK?

Time lapses work by making the frame rate of capture slower than the frame rate of playback. This ""speeds up"" the action and makes it seem as though as things are moving faster than they really are. Time lapses are temporal illusions that work due to the difference between the rate of capture and the rate of playback.

WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF A TIME-LAPSE?

Time lapses serve the function of showing the passage of time, both temporally forward and backwards. For example, a time lapse video of a growing head of hair can be played in reverse to seem like it is rapidly disappearing. Time lapses also serve the function of showing grand-scale change over time. For example, time lapse photography is used to capture changes to our ecosystem, which is used as key evidence in scientific research into climate change.

HOW TO SHOOT A GOOD TIME LAPSE

It's never been easier to shoot a time lapse. Today, most cameras have time lapse presets, where you can choose the rate of capture. If you're getting started with time lapse photography or videography, consider keeping your camera still. This will reduce chaos and emphasize changes in the frame. As you advance your time lapse skills, you can play with perspective in motion by utilizing whips, pans, and other cinematographic techniques.

SUBPLOT SCREENPLAY

Rarely does a movie just focus on one single storyline. Screenwriters will often balance their time between multiple stories, with one primary narrative. The stories that are secondary to this primary narrative are called subplots, or B-stories (or C-stories). Subplots can add texture and depth to a film, informing characters, themes, and much more. In this video, we look at subplot types, their uses, and how to structure them in your larger story.

TYPES OF SUBPLOT

Subplots come in many forms. A romantic subplot is exceedingly common, often providing a softer counterpoint to the primary narrative. This type can humanize characters and make them more relatable. An expository subplot, meanwhile, offers background information or context, often revealing key details about a character’s past or the story world. This helps deepen the audience's understanding without bogging down the main plot with exposition.

A parallel subplot mirrors the main story, showing a secondary character undergoing a similar journey or exploring the same themes. A contrasting subplot, on the other hand, offers a storyline that runs counter to the main plot, highlighting differences and providing an opposing perspective. This can serve as a dramatic foil.

WHY USE SUBPLOTS IN MOVIES

Subplots enhance the main story by adding complexity and emotional depth. They allow for richer character development and exploration of themes, making a narrative feel more multi-dimensional. For example, a romantic subplot in a thriller can reveal a softer side of a hardened protagonist, deepening the audience's connection to the character. Subplots can also delay the resolution of the main conflict, building tension and keeping the audience engaged.

SUBPLOT STORYTELLING STRUCTURE

A subplot follows a similar structure to the main plot, with its own inciting incident, conflict, and resolution, but on a smaller scale. The subplot should be introduced early, develop alongside the main plot, and be interwoven naturally to avoid feeling disjointed. Or, it can arise later in a film. The subplot’s resolution can occur before or alongside the main plot’s climax, contributing to the overall payoff. When executed well, subplots enhance the main story without overshadowing it, creating a richer and multilayered narrative.

HOW TO WRITE BETTER CONFLICT FOR BEGINNER WRITERS

You can't have a story without conflict. This may sound like a massive generalization, but it's true. Even the most nonlinear and meander narratives contain conflict. This is because conflict refers to a character's goals hitting an obstacle. A character's goals may be subtle, and the obstacles may be minuscule, but they are always present in a story. Today, we look at the different kinds of conflict, and how screenwriters can use them.

INTERNAL CONFLICT

Inner conflict, or internal conflict, occurs within a character. This type of conflict often revolves around moral dilemmas, self-doubt, or a clash between what a character wants to do and what they need to do. A character’s internal turmoil is often not spoken but shown through their actions, or inactions. For example, a protagonist might be torn between following their ambition and maintaining their integrity. The audience should feel the weight of this conflict as the character makes decisions throughout the film.

PERSONAL CONFLICT

Personal conflict stems from a character’s relationships with others, such as antagonists, or friends, family, or romantic partners (or both). This conflict is often emotional and rooted in opposing goals, values, or personalities. To write personal conflict effectively, consider what the character needs versus what their relationships demand. For example, in a romantic film, two characters might love each other but have wildly different life plans, creating friction and driving the story forward. In many cases, these conflicts serve as emotional anchors for the audience, as they can easily relate to the complexities of human relationships.

EXTERNAL CONFLICT

Extrapersonal conflict comes from forces outside the individual, like societal norms, nature, or a larger entity like the government. For example, in dystopian films, a character might fight against an oppressive regime, adding layers of stakes and danger. Extrapersonal conflict can be achieved through vivid world-building, establishing high stakes, and showing how the larger conflict impacts the character's personal life or inner struggles. Balancing this external pressure with inner and personal conflict can create a rich, multidimensional narrative that keeps the audience invested.

Conflict is the motor of a story: without it, a narrative is adrift. Next time you're writing your script, think carefully about what types of conflict you're using, and how they inform character and each other.

HOW TO WRITE A CHARACTER INTRODUCTION

We all now the truism that first impressions are everything. This carries over to characters too. How an audience is introduced to a character colors how they will perceive them for the rest of the movie. A filmmaker can then build on these expectations, or subvert them. But it all starts with their entrance.

HOW TO WRITE CHARACTERS' INTRODUCTION IN THE SCRIPT

The character’s introduction begins in the screenplay, where the writer gives the audience its first impression. This description is often brief but crucial. Writers will often highlight key traits such as age, demeanor, or defining characteristics, while leaving room for the actor's interpretation. Screenplay descriptions can help shape casting decisions and give directors cues for the character’s look and presence on screen.

CHARACTER INTRO LOOKS

When a character appears for the first time on screen, how they look says a lot about who they are. This includes their clothing and body language, as well as how they're framed by the camera. A well-thought-out appearance can tell the audience if a character is confident, sloppy, wealthy, or struggling. The director, costume designer, and cinematographer collaborate to ensure that the character's visual introduction packs a punch.

INTRODUCING CHARACTERS WITH DIALOGUE

A character's first line of dialogue is crucial in conveying their personality and role. Whether it's a snappy remark, a shy introduction, or a commanding order, the way they speak reveals how they want to be perceived or what motivates them. The tone, choice of words, and even the silence before speaking are all tools to shape how the audience reacts to them.

CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS THROUGH ACTION

A character’s first action often solidifies their personality and place within the story. Their behavior immediately reveals something about their role in the narrative. An action can define courage, fear, kindness, or aggression, and it creates an immediate emotional connection with the audience. A character who rescues someone in their first scene is perceived differently from someone who stumbles into danger.

A great character introduction can get an audience fully invested in your movie. No matter what twists and turns you have coming, they're committed to following you character.

FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA FILMMAKING

Very few people would dispute that Francis Ford Coppola has made some of the most important movies of the 20th century. And yet, Coppola's career has been anything but smooth sailing. Despite his massive success early on, he has hit rough patches that are about as rough a patch as a career can hit. In our research, we've found that what makes Coppola so great is also what makes him a financial liability: he is never afraid to take a risk.

FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA CINEMATOGRAPHY

In *The Godfather* (1972), Coppola took significant risks with cinematography, particularly in the way he collaborated with director of photography Gordon Willis. Known as ""The Prince of Darkness,"" Willis employed an unconventional use of shadows and dim lighting to create a haunting and operatic visual tone. Many scenes, especially in the interiors, are underlit, defying Hollywood norms of brightly lit characters and settings. 

FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA SOUND DESIGN

With *The Conversation* (1974), Coppola turned his attention to sound, pushing the boundaries of what sound design could achieve in film. The film's central theme revolves around audio surveillance, and Coppola made the risky choice to immerse the audience in the protagonist’s experience through experimental use of sound. 

THE GODFATHER PART II STORY STRUCTURE

*The Godfather Part II* (1974) further demonstrated Coppola’s willingness to break conventional rules, especially in terms of story structure. The film's nonlinear narrative, cutting between the rise of young Vito Corleone and the corruption of his son Michael, was a bold departure from the linear storytelling common in Hollywood. 

FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA EDITING

In *Apocalypse Now* (1979), Coppola’s risk-taking extended to editing. The production itself was notoriously chaotic, but the editing process, led by Walter Murch, was a particular gamble. Coppola allowed the film’s pacing and structure to become dreamlike and fragmented.

THE BLUNDER OF COPPOLA FILMS

The production of *One from the Heart* (1981) stands as one of Coppola’s biggest risks. Shot entirely on soundstages with extravagant sets and heavy use of rear-projection, it was an artistic experiment that aimed to blur the lines between theater and cinema.

DRACULA AND A RETURN TO FORM

Finally, in *Bram Stoker's Dracula* (1992), Coppola took a major gamble with special effects. Instead of relying on the burgeoning field of digital effects, he committed to in-camera techniques. This meant employing miniatures, rear-projection, and trick photography to create a stylized, expressionistic horror aesthetic.

ANATOMY OF GREAT DIALOGUE

Movie audiences have a great ear for dialogue. They know when it's good, and they know when it's bad. This means that for screenwriters, the ability to write believable and compelling conversations is a must. And while it's easy to recognize dialogue as good or bad, it's much harder to understand why and how. Let's take a look at how to write dialogue.

VOICE IN DIALOGUE

First and foremost, each character should have a distinct voice. This distinctiveness ensures that viewers can easily differentiate between characters and understand their personalities and motivations. A distinct voice is crafted through individual speech patterns, vocabulary, and tone. For example, a character might speak in a formal, elaborate manner to reflect their education or background, while another might use colloquial language and slang to indicate a more casual, street-smart demeanor. This differentiation not only adds authenticity but also deepens character development, allowing audiences to engage more fully with the story.

BEST DIALOGUE EXPOSITION

Effective dialogue must also serve the purpose of delivering information in a way that feels natural and engaging. It’s essential that exposition is woven seamlessly into conversations rather than dumped in large, awkward chunks. Dialogue that doesn't push story forward, or deliver new information, should be examined by the screenwriter– is it totally necessary?

CONVERSATIONAL DIALOGUE TIPS

Most dialogue is in conversation, not just a monologue. Conversation means debates, disagreements, and varied perspectives that drive the narrative forward and highlight character development. A heated argument between characters can reveal their underlying values and conflicts, enriching the story and enhancing dramatic tension. By incorporating conflict and contrasting viewpoints, dialogue becomes a powerful tool for revealing deeper layers of character.

Great dialogue is essential for (most) great movies. But remember: great dialogue doesn't look or sound one way. It can be arched and over-the-top, or understated and realistic. It's hard to say what makes dialogue great. But you know it when you hear it.

REPEAT CUT TUTORIAL

Most mainstream Hollywood movies adhere to continuity editing. In other words, the edit is meant to be invisible, the cuts barely registered by the audience. But there are many more creative editing techniques out there. They may call attention to themselves, but often for good reason. One of such technique is the repeat cut, where an editor purposefully repeats an action or overlaps frames-- put simply, jumps back in time.

REPEAT FILM EDITING FOR BEGINNERS

One of the primary uses of the repeat cut is to enhance spectacle. By revisiting a visually stunning or pivotal shot, filmmakers can amplify the impact of a scene. For example, a repeat cut might emphasize a dramatic moment, such as a sequence of an explosion (this is very common) or a climactic battle. This repetition allows the audience to fully absorb the grandeur of the spectacle.

CREATIVE FILM EDITING

In addition to its role in spectacle, the repeat cut can help a filmmaker delve into a character's psyche. By revisiting a specific moment from a character’s perspective, filmmakers can provide deeper insight into their emotional state or psychological turmoil. It can also be used to highlight the character's obsession or fixation on a particular event, enriching the audience’s understanding of their motivation or inner conflict.

THEMATIC REPEAT CUT EXAMPLES

The repeat cut can also augment a film’s thematic depth. By repeating visual motifs, symbols, or narrative elements, filmmakers can underscore recurring themes or ideas. This repetition helps to create a cohesive thematic structure, allowing the audience to draw connections and interpret the film's message on a more profound level.

The repeat cut is a powerful tool that contains multitudes. Continuity editing is great, but don't be afraid to experiment. There's more than one way to keep an audience engaged.

FURIOSA BEHIND THE SCENES

Making a follow-up to Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the most celebrated action movies of the century, is not an enviable task. Luckily, George Miller isn't a director who's afraid to take risks. With Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Miller expanded the world and palette of Mad Max while honoring its predecessor's breath-taking action sequences. In this video, we take a look at how Miller upped his game for the action in Furiosa.

MAD MAX FURIOSA PREPRODUCTION

The action sequences in Furiosa required extensive prep work, rooted in both creative vision and technical precision. The pre-production phase involved detailed pre-visualization, where each sequence was mapped out using the Unreal Engine. This process replaced the analogue approach taken in Fury Road. It allowed director George Miller and the stunt coordinators to choreograph every movement down to the second, ensuring that the high-speed chases and combat scenes could be executed safely and efficiently.

FURIOSA A MAD MAX SAGA EQUIPMENT

The film was primarily shot on the ARRI Alexa 65 camera, chosen for its large-format sensor. These cameras were often paired with ARRI DNA Prime lenses. For capturing high-speed sequences, the production utilized the Edge Arm, a crane system mounted on pursuit vehicles, which allowed the camera to remain stable and nimble even at high speeds. Drones equipped with RED Komodo and V-Raptor cameras were used for aerial shots, providing dynamic, bird's-eye views of the action. These smaller cameras could also be mounted to vehicles for up-close footage.

THE MAKING OF FURIOSA VFX

While, like Fury Road, the film heavily emphasized practical effects, visual effects were crucial in realizing certain elements of Furiosa’s action sequences. The VFX team created digital extensions of the practical sets, expanded the post-apocalyptic landscapes, and enhanced the scale of the action. Compositing techniques were employed to merge practical stunts with CGI elements, ensuring that every frame felt grounded and realistic. The post-production phase involved meticulous work in color grading and visual continuity, ensuring that the practical and digital elements blended seamlessly into the final film, delivering a cohesive visual experience.

With Furiosa, George Miller did what many thought might be impossible: live up to the hype of Fury Road.

PROFESSIONAL SOUND RECORDING FOR FILM

So you're making a movie. This probably means you'll need sound. For beginning filmmakers, sound can mistakenly be an afterthought, a task to give a generous friend. But recording great sound is vital to the success of a movie, whether it be a no-budget short or a blockbuster movie. In this episode of The Shot List, we look at how a production sound mixer operates on set to get the best audio possible.

HOW TO RECORD SOUND FOR FILM

The production sound mixer works closely with the director and other departments to ensure that the audio quality matches the visual production. This means often being present on tech scouts and being vocal about any potential sound issues that may arrise. The job requires a keen ear, technical expertise, and the ability to adapt to various on-set challenges, such as background noise or difficult acoustic environments. The production sound mixer typically uses high-quality microphones, a mixing console, and recording devices to capture the sound directly during filming.

INTERIOR FILM SET SOUND RECORDING

Interiors often present challenges such as echoes, reverb, or unwanted noise from HVAC systems. To mitigate these issues, sound mixers may use directional microphones like shotgun mics to focus on the audio source while minimizing ambient noise. Placing sound blankets or foam around the set can help absorb excess sound, creating a cleaner recording environment. Boom operators need to carefully position microphones to capture clear dialogue without picking up noise from the set. Often, lav microphones might be used to ensure consistent audio quality.

HOW TO RECORD SOUND FOR EXTERIORS

Recording sound outdoors introduces a different set of challenges, such as wind, traffic, and other environmental noises. To combat these (and other) issues, sound mixers often use windshields or “dead cats” on microphones to reduce wind noise. Directional microphones are once again crucial in exterior settings to isolate dialogue from background noise. Planning is key when recording outside—choosing the right time of day or scouting quieter locations can significantly improve sound quality.

Sound is one-half of a movie. That can often be easy to forget– but a great filmmaker always keeps that in mind. Save money in the budget for a sound pro.

AV SCRIPT MADE EASY

AV scripts are vital tools for a wide variety of media, from music videos to explainer videos to corporate videos. They comprehensively outline everything that will go into a video, from audio to visuals to the timing of both elements. With StudioBinder, the process of writing an AV script is incredibly straight forward. Let's take a look at all that you can do in an AV script.

HOW TO WRITE AN AV SCRIPT

The first step in creating an AV script is to establish the goals and structure based on the type of content you're producing. With StudioBinder, you can easily create segments and banners to organize your script into sections like introductions, conclusions, and main content, providing a clear and logical flow. You can add or remove segments, giving you flexibility as your script evolves.

When writing the audio or voiceover, you'll use the left-hand column. This section can include voiceover, lyrics, sound effects, or music. In StudioBinder, you can enhance your script by using stylized text (bold, italics) and adding links to pronunciation guides, audio samples, or music tracks. This feature helps in making the script more interactive and precise, ensuring that every audio detail is accounted for.

AV SCRIPT HACKS FOR VISUALS

Next, it's time to plan out your visuals. This includes character actions, shot sizes, camera angles, and movements. StudioBinder goes a step further by offering a dedicated image column where you can add visual references, floorplans, storyboards, or even video clips. These visual elements can be imported from previous projects or captured directly within the platform, ensuring your script is visually aligned with your creative vision.

Timing your script is critical, especially for time-sensitive media like commercials and music videos. StudioBinder automatically calculates the word count for each line and segment, helping you manage the script's duration. You can also add specific durations to each line or use the built-in stopwatch for more precise measurements, ensuring your script stays within your desired runtime.

SHARE YOUR TWO COLUMN SCRIPT

Finally, it's time to share your script. You can share the script digitally with a “view-only” link or add collaborators for direct comments on the project. The platform allows for line-specific comments that follow the script even if changes are made, and you can use status colors to mark each row for easy collaboration. This feature streamlines the feedback process, making it more efficient and allowing for a more polished final script before production begins.

GOOD CHARACTER MOTIVATION

Anything we do, we do for a reason. It may not be a reason we're aware of, but there is a reason nonetheless. The same goes for characters. When you are writing, you should have a keen understanding of why a character is doing what they're doing. This is called character motivation.

MASLOW'S HIERARCHY AND MOTIVATION

We can use Maslow's hierarchy to understand types of motivation. There are physiological needs, including basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. Then there's safety and security, such as personal and financial stability. Next is love and belongingness— a character's need to fit into their community and find a romantic partner. Characters also pursue esteem, striving for self-confidence and recognition.

At the highest level, characters may seek self-actualization, which represents personal growth and fulfillment. In Whiplash, Andrew Neiman’s drive for excellence as a drummer is driven by interpersonal conflict with his demanding mentor and internal struggles about the mentor’s influence.

ESTABLISHING MOTIVATION TIPS

What good is motivation if it's not established? Dialogue can provide direct insights, as seen in Gladiator with Maximus’s declaration of vengeance. Backstory also reveals motivations, such as Walter White’s past in Breaking Bad, which fuels his quest for respect. Of course, what a character does also informs motivation.

PURSUING CHARACTER MOTIVATION

Characters may pursue their motivations linearly or through fluctuations. In a linear fashion, characters work steadily towards their goals, as seen in Erin Brockovich, where the protagonist strives to expose environmental issues. Alternatively, motivations may shift due to new revelations or personal growth, like in Juno, where the protagonist’s goals evolve from seeking an abortion to finding an adoptive family, and in Silver Linings Playbook, where Pat’s motivations change alongside his relationship with Tiffany. 

Character motivation is omnipresent in narrative storytelling. Keep it in mind for your next project, or your protagonist may be aimless and scattered.

THEORY OF EMOTION IN FILM

Movies can make us feel emotions that our daily lives might only rarely give to us. Cinema's power to move is arguably what made it the dominant art form of the 20th century, and what continues to bring audiences to it today. So how do filmmakers make us feel? What are the cinematic techniques that help make an audience laugh, cry, gasp, or all of the above?

INTRODUCTION TO EMOTION WRITING

The feelings present in your film begin on the page. Writing compelling dialogue and relatable characters is key. Dialogue should reflect their internal struggles and desires, creating a connection with the audience. Subtext, where characters say one thing but mean another, can deepen emotional resonance. Repetition can also be powerful, bringing certain elements from earlier in the story into a new context.

VISUAL EMOTION THEORY

Visual storytelling amplifies the emotional tone set by the script. Cinematography plays a crucial role in conveying emotions; shot composition, camera angles, and lighting all contribute to the mood. Close-ups can capture subtle expressions and intensify emotional moments, while wide shots can underscore isolation or vastness. Color palettes also influence emotion; warm tones might evoke comfort or passion, while cool tones can suggest sadness or detachment.

EMOTIONS IN THE EDIT

In post-production, sound design, music, and editing further enhance emotional impact. Music scores can heighten emotional moments by aligning with the narrative’s emotional arc– it's perhaps the most powerful tool to make an audience feel. Editing techniques, such as pacing and rhythm, can build tension or create relief. Juxtaposing scenes and timing emotional beats precisely can guide the audience’s emotions, making moments of resolution or heartbreak pack more of a punch.

By blending these elements, filmmakers can effectively evoke emotions, creating unforgettable cinematic experiences.

You've probably heard the term ""method acting"" and you might even think of it in terms of extreme techniques. But the real story behind method acting is a lot more complicated than that. In this video, we're breaking down the origins of method acting, who was involved, and how it evolved.

Stanislavski’s groundbreaking techniques revolutionized the world of acting, emphasizing naturalistic performance, emotional authenticity, and the importance of an actor’s inner life. His approach laid the foundation for what would become a transformative force in the acting world: Method Acting.

From Stanislavski's teachings, we branch out into the American schools of Method Acting, where three of his most prominent disciples—Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner—each developed their unique interpretations and methodologies, shaping the future of acting in distinct ways.

First, we delve into Lee Strasberg’s approach. Strasberg, often referred to as the father of Method Acting in America, placed a strong emphasis on emotional recall and sensory memory. He believed that by drawing on their own past experiences and emotions, actors could achieve a deeper, more truthful connection to their characters. This intense focus on personal experience and inner truth became a hallmark of Strasberg’s technique, influencing countless actors and leading to the establishment of the Actors Studio, where his methods continued to be taught and refined.

Next, we explore Stella Adler’s contributions to Method Acting. Unlike Strasberg, Adler placed less emphasis on emotional recall, instead advocating for the power of imagination and the importance of understanding the text. Adler’s teachings encouraged actors to deeply analyze scripts, understand their characters’ motivations, and bring their imaginations to life on stage and screen. Her approach offered a more external and analytical pathway to authenticity in performance.

Finally, we examine Sanford Meisner’s unique perspective on Method Acting. Meisner developed a technique that focused on the actors’ interactions with one another and their immediate responses to the present moment. His famous repetition exercises were designed to help actors become fully immersed in the reality of the scene, fostering spontaneity and genuine emotional reactions.

While Strasberg, Adler, and Meisner each had their distinct methods, they all shared a commitment to truthfulness, authenticity, and the profound emotional engagement of the actor.

FILM SOUND RECORDING FOR BEGINNERS

Pretty much every live action movie made today requires sound to be recorded on set. Sound, after all, is one half of the film experience. And yet, sound is often undervalued and under-considered when beginning filmmakers are on set. In this episode of the Shot List, we dive into the extremely important, and complex, world of production sound.

WHAT IS SOUND?

To understand how to record sound, you need to know the physics of how sound is made and captured. Sound is a vibration that travels through air or another medium and can be heard when it reaches a person's or animal's ear. It is produced by vibrating objects, creating pressure waves in the surrounding medium. Recording sound involves capturing these vibrations using a microphone, which converts them into electrical signals. These signals are then processed and stored in a digital or analog format.

RECORDING SOUND FOR FILM

There are a plethora of terms you need to know if you want to work in the sound department on a film. There's the single system vs. the double system, the sound cart, polar patterns, pre-amps...The list goes on and on. And this isn't to mention the different types of mics, like the lavalier, the shotgun, dynamic mics, compressor mics, and much more.

PRODUCTION SOUND MIXERS AND MORE

So who exactly is a part of the sound department? The production sound mixer oversees the department, ensuring all sound is recorded clearly. The boom operator manages the boom microphone, positioning it to capture dialogue without being visible in the shot. Sound utility technicians assist with setting up equipment, managing cables, and handling additional microphones. They also troubleshoot technical issues.

HOW TO RECORD SOUND

Recording good sound on a film set is crucial as it enhances the overall quality and realism of the film. Clear, well-captured audio ensures that dialogue is intelligible and immersive, directly affecting audience engagement. Poor sound quality can distract viewers, undermining the film's impact. So the next time you're on set, make sure your sound guy is a pro.

WHAT IS COMEDY AND HOW TO BE FUNNY

One of the fundamental genres of storytelling is the comedy. Whether it be 1000 BC or 2000 AD, people love to laugh. It's a good feeling. So understanding how to make people laugh is an incredibly powerful tool. In filmmaking, having a comedic sensibility will take you far, no matter what genre you hope to work in. Today, jokes abound in genres far outside of comedies, from horror to historical genre. In this video, we'll look at how to get your audience to laugh.

TYPES OF COMEDY MOVIES

Comedy in movies can take many forms. Slapstick, known for its physical humor and exaggerated actions, dates back to silent film stars like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Romantic comedies blend humor with love stories, relying on witty banter and situational humor to explore relationships. Farces, such as ""Airplane!"" use wild exaggeration and caricaturist characters to find humor. Satirical comedies, like ""Dr. Strangelove,"" use humor to critique societal norms and political issues. These are just a few comedy subgenres– you can combine comedy with any other genre to create another.

HOW TO WRITE COMEDY

Effective comedy writing often hinges on the principles of exaggeration and subversion. Exaggeration amplifies reality to absurd levels, creating humor through the sheer scale of the overstatement. This technique can be seen in the over-the-top characters and scenarios of films like ""Dumb and Dumber.""

Subversion, meanwhile, involves diverging from expectations. By setting up familiar tropes or situations and then delivering an unexpected twist, writers can surprise and amuse audiences. The ""rule of three"" is a common comedic structure: the first two instances set a pattern, and the third breaks it in a comedic way.

THE ART OF COMEDY VISUALS

Visual comedy leverages staging, production design, editing, and more to enhance humor. Staging involves the precise placement and movement of actors within the frame, often creating humor through physical interactions and timing. Visual gags, such as sight gags and background jokes, reward attentive viewers and add layers to the comedy. Films like ""Naked Gun"" and ""Airplane!"" excel in visual comedy, filling every frame with potential for laughter through meticulously crafted visual elements. Production design can contribute to the comedy by exaggerating settings or props. Editing is crucial in comedic timing, with quick cuts and reaction shots enhancing the punchlines.

There is no one surefire way to make someone laugh. Comedy is a leap of faith– in the end, you can only guess how an audience might react. But there are few things better than when your joke hits just right.

WHAT IS A FRAMED NARRATIVE

Sometimes, a narrative contains multiple stories. You've likely seen it before– a character in one story starts to weave another, separate tale. This structure is called a frame narrative, where stories are told within stories. In this video, we'll look at why storytellers love this technique, what power they can bring to a story, and how they work.

TYPES OF FRAME STORIES

Frame narratives can take many different forms. There's the most common, the bookend, which begins and ends with a character telling a story. Then there's the flashbacks, which can be similarly structured. There's also in-story media, where there is a book or TV show or film taking place within the story. There's also the series of stories, where a much of different tales are told sequentially. And finally, there's the story within a story within a story, where there's more than two layers to the onion.

WHY USE FRAMED NARRATIVES

Frame narratives serve several functions in film. First, they provide a structural framework that organizes the main narrative, offering a context or perspective that enriches the audience's understanding of the story. This can create depth by providing additional layers of meaning or by juxtaposing different perspectives on the same events.

Second, frame narratives can enhance engagement by drawing viewers into the story through the process of discovery or through the lens of a storyteller's perspective. They can also serve as a narrative device to establish themes, set the tone, or create suspense by delaying the revelation of crucial information until the appropriate moment.

HOW TO WRITE FRAMED TALES

Writing a framed narrative requires clarity. Make sure your reader can follow what timeline is what. You'll also need to decide on who is narrating the story-- is it your protagonist, a side character, or no one? Make sure you ask yourself why you're writing a frame narrative. If it can work as a more straight forward story, you might not need to bog yourself down with framing.

By mastering the art of frame narratives, filmmakers can create intricate, thought-provoking films that resonate with audiences long after the credits roll. Whether used to explore psychological depths, showcase diverse perspectives, or simply enhance storytelling complexity, frame narratives remain a powerful tool in the cinematic toolbox.

CLIMAX VS ANTICLIMAX — DEFINITION, EXAMPLES, AND EFFECTS

When approaching the end of their story, writers have two options — climax or anticlimax. In most cases, a climax is the most natural and satisfying conclusion but an anticlimax can be just as effective. In this video, we will break down the differences between climax vs anticlimax, the pros/cons of each, and how writers can use either to great effect.

WHAT IS A CLIMAX

A climax is when the main conflict of a scene, act, or story is finally resolved. In more dramatic stories, this might be an emotional peak; in more action-driven stories, this might be a spectacular set piece. In all cases, it is the pinnacle of what that particular story was building toward.

WHAT IS AN ANTICLIMAX

Conversely, the anticlimax is a subversion or denial of that resolution. In a romance story, the two leads may not end up together. In a revenge tale, when the hero finally has their target in sight, they take no action. Most of the time, these anticlimactic endings aren't the product of shoddy writing, they are intentional decisions made by the writer for comedic purposes or to make some larger point.

Even though a vast majority of stories end in a climax, it is not the only option. As a writer, knowing your options can allow you to meet or subvert expectations as you craft the right ending for that particular story.

THE WALK AND TALK SHOT

We all know the walk and talk. It has become a staple of film and TV, and the butt of a plethora of jokes. But what is it about the walk and talk that filmmakers love so much? And what makes a good walk and talk good? We’ll answer all those questions and more in this video.

WALK AND TALK METHODS 

Walk and talk shots can vary in style. Shot size can range from wide shots, capturing the characters and their surroundings, to medium shots that focus more on the characters while still providing some context, and close-ups that highlight facial expressions and emotions. 

Camera angle is another crucial aspect; low angles can create a sense of power or urgency, while high angles may imply vulnerability or insignificance. Camera movement adds fluidity and can follow the characters, move with them smoothly, or provide a handheld, shaky effect for more intensity.

WALK & TALK BLOCKING

Effective blocking and staging are crucial for successful walk and talk scenes. Blocking involves planning where actors will move and interact within the space, ensuring their actions appear natural and purposeful. 

In walk and talk shots, the camera often moves with the actors, requiring precise coordination to maintain focus and composition. This synchronization between actors' movements and camera work is crucial for maintaining the scene's rhythm and ensuring the dialogue flows seamlessly. But the camera can also be stationary, adding an entirely different feel to the scene. 

WHY USE A WALK AND TALK

Walk and talks serve many purposes. They add dynamism to exposition, making otherwise dramatically static scenes more engaging. They also convey urgency, as characters often discuss pressing matters while moving through spaces. 

Walk and talks also immerse the audience in the environment, providing context and background information organically. They can create a continuous sense of movement and progression in the story, keeping viewers engaged and invested in the characters’ journey. It’s no wonder why filmmakers return to the technique again and again.

THE ART OF PERSUASION

Nothing feels better than winning an argument. Luckily, Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle gifted us with what is referred to as the rhetorical triangle– three rhetorical tools which act as the basis of nearly any good argument. If you’re looking to persuade an audience, look no further. We walk through what goes into a good piece of persuasion.

ETHOS

Ethos focuses on establishing the credibility of the speaker or writer. This is achieved by presenting yourself as knowledgeable, trustworthy, and ethical. Credibility can be built through experience and expertise— for example, a doctor speaking about the benefits of a particular medication uses their medical background to enhance their credibility. Without ethos, arguments may lack authority and fail to convince an audience of the speaker's trustworthiness.

PATHOS

Pathos aims to evoke an emotional response from the audience. By appealing to emotions such as fear, anger, or joy, speakers can deeply connect with their listeners. Advertisements often use pathos by showing heartwarming scenes to evoke empathy and persuade viewers to buy a product. Pathos is incredibly powerful: it taps into human values and desires, influencing decision-making through emotional engagement.

LOGS

Logos refers to appealing to the audience's sense of reason and logic. This is typically  done through presenting logical arguments, facts, and evidence. Think of scientific papers, which rely heavily on logos to support their claims with data and experiments. Without logical reasoning, arguments can appear weak or unsubstantiated, failing to convince an audience grounded in rationality.

THREE PERSUASIVE APPEALS

Ethos, pathos, and logos are essential to persuasive communication, each serving distinct purposes in influencing an audience. Effective communicators often blend these strategies to create compelling arguments that resonate intellectually and emotionally. 

Understanding and mastering these techniques can enhance one's ability to persuade and convey ideas effectively in various contexts, from filmmaking to writing and advertising. By leveraging ethos, pathos, and logos appropriately, communicators can craft messages that not only inform but also inspire and persuade audiences to take action or adopt a particular viewpoint.

HAIR AND MAKEUP EXPLAINED

When you think of a film set, you likely think of the director, cinematographer, producer, production designer, and maybe even the sound guy. But often forgotten in the discussion of filmmaking is hair and makeup, two vital departments that are crucial to a movie’s look. Today, we examine the role of HMU.

HAIRSTYLISTS IN FILM

Hair styling in film is essential for character development and storytelling. A well-groomed hairstyle can suggest wealth or vanity, while a messy look may imply turmoil or carelessness. Period films rely on historically accurate hairdos, often using wigs and hairpieces to achieve the desired look. Professional hairstylists ensure hair looks consistent and natural under different lighting conditions, maintaining the character's intended look throughout filming.

BASIC MAKEUP

Basic makeup enhances actors' natural features, ensuring they appear flawless on camera (unattainable beauty standards, anyone?). This involves creating a smooth skin tone, accentuating eyes and lips, and subtly contouring the face to look good under various lighting conditions. Basic makeup can compensate for the flattening effect of bright film lights and aligns with the character's personality and the film’s visual style. Makeup artists also make subtle adjustments throughout the shoot to maintain continuity.

SPECIAL EFFECTS MAKEUP

Special effects makeup transforms actors in ways basic makeup cannot, creating sci-fi creatures, aging characters, or injuries. This typically involves prosthetics, latex, and other materials for detailed effects. Creating believable aliens or monsters requires hours of intricate work, layering materials to form lifelike textures.

Aging makeup adds decades to an actor’s appearance with techniques highlighting wrinkles and skin changes. Injury effects, like cuts and burns, are meticulously crafted for authenticity. Special effects makeup artists blend artistic skill with anatomy to achieve these transformations, crucial for an immersive film experience.

Hair, basic makeup, and special effects makeup are vital components of filmmaking, significantly contributing to character portrayal and the overall narrative. Together, they enhance visual storytelling, ensuring characters are believable and the story engages the audience.

CATHARSIS DEFINITION

Most movies aim to make you feel. That feeling may be joy, fear, sadness, or something else entirely. But no matter the kind of emotion, the biggest emotional moment in a film is typically the catharsis. The term “catharsis” has been around for millenia, coined by Greek philosopher Aristotle. It refers to the purification or purging of emotions, typically in works of art. In this video, we look at how catharsis is created, and what it looks like in different contexts.

CATHARSIS ROLE IN TRAGEDY

The traditional use of catharsis referred to the ending of tragedies. Aristotle argued that tragedies should “arous[e] fear and pity,” allowing the audience to expel these negative emotions and feel better in their day-to-day life. The philosopher discussed four ways catharsis could be created in tragedy, relying on two axes: knowingly and unknowingly, and completed or stopped. In other words, the four kinds of endings are knowingly completed, unknowingly completed, knowingly stopped, or unknowingly stopped.

CATHARSIS EXAMPLES IN TRIUMPH

Today, catharsis can reach far beyond tragedies. If you haven’t noticed, Hollywood isn’t a fan of sad endings, and yet, most great movies have finales that move us. That’s catharsis in a triumphant setting. This type of catharsis relies on tension– the audience must understand the stakes and want them to be resolved. Catharsis in triumph doesn’t need to be obvious; in fact, some of the greatest endings have very subtle cathartic moments. 

CATHARSIS EXPLAINED

No matter the genre, catharsis can be split into two parts: the set up, and the pay off. The set up is the entire movie up until the point of the catharsis. This is where the stakes are set, we see the character’s arc, and we understand the themes. The catharsis then is the pay off, where these various elements are resolved, or at least utilized.

Catharsis is an extremely powerful tool which can act as an emotional gut-punch. Pull it off, and your audience may never forget the feelings you made them feel.

PACING YOUR STORIES

In its essence, pacing is simple– it’s how quickly, or slowly, you tell a story. But in practice, the concept can be exceedingly difficult to master. You don’t have to take our word for it. Celebrated filmmakers with decades of experience under their belt will still miss the mark on pacing, and critics will be quick to call them out for it. In this video, we look at the elusive concept of pacing, and some strategies you can take to avoid bad pacing in movies.

WRITING PACING

Pacing begins on the page. A screenwriter is the one who first and foremost dictates the larger pacing of the overall narrative. Major events may happen at a breakneck speed, from one scene to the next, or an entire film may be a slow motion build to one big emotional beat.

But a screenwriter can also influence pacing on an intra-scene level. In this regard, line breaks are a writer’s best friend. They can slow down the rate of a sequence by simply making each action its own line, or multiple lines. Alternatively, a writer can push for snappy dialogue by omitting action lines.

PACING VIDEOS AS A DIRECTOR

Pacing can be further articulated on set. Erratic camera movement will make a scene feel more energetic and fast (think of the work of Michael Bay, for example). On the other end, a director might opt for more minimal camera moves, or no camera moves, which can make a scene feel meditative and slow. Pacing can also come from actors. In consultation with a director, an actor can decide how quickly they go through dialogue or execute an action.

EDIT PACING OF THE VIDEO

In a way, editing is the art of pacing. An editor’s primary decision is how long to hold on a shot. The longer they hold on a shot, typically, the slower the pace. Rapid cutting, conversely, will lead to rapid pacing. An editor can dictate pacing on a more macro scale, using montages to blow through large spans of story in a matter of minutes. They can also use music to affect how an audience perceives pacing.

As you may be able to tell, pacing is a consideration from the beginning to the end of the filmmaking process. This is why it can be so difficult to achieve, there are so many areas where pacing can go wrong. But with careful attention, anyone can find great pacing.

IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE SUMMARY

Editing is one of the fundamental pillars of filmmaking, and perhaps no editor is more revered than Walter Murch. Murch came to prominence during the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s, cutting films like American Graffiti and Apocalypse Now. Murch is also a renowned sound designer; in fact, he was the first person to receive that credit. 

All of this is to say that Walter Murch is a man who knows editing. That’s why his book, In the Blink of an Eye, is seen as something of a Magna Carta for editors. In this video, we break down the lessons from Murch’s classic text and see why they remain relevant today. 

FILM EDITING EXPLAINED

Much of the beginning of In the Blink of an Eye concerns itself with why editing works. In other words, why is an audience not distracted when there is a cut from one shot to another? Murch lays out a few different theories. He compares editing logic to that of dreaming. Images come to us disparately, but we interpret them to create a singular, coherent idea. 

Murch also claims that editing bears relation to blinking (hence the title of his book). This theory extends beyond the obvious comparison that we “cut” when we blink. Murch argues that we blink when we’ve had a complete thought or are experiencing a shift in emotion. As such, Murch recommends editing close to, or on, an actor’s blink. 

WALTER MURCH 6 RULES
Perhaps the most famous instruction to come out of Blink of an Eye is Murch’s Rule of 6. These are the considerations an editor should take into account when making a cut, ranked from most important to least important. The first is emotion— the cut should serve the feeling of the scene. The second is story — the cut should inform the story. The third is rhythm. The fourth is eye trace — the subject of one frame should be in the same space as the subject of the next frame. The fifth is the 180-degree rule, and the sixth is the three-dimensional space of action. 

WALTER MURCH ON EDITING CAREERS
Murch spends much of the rest of his book talking about the in’s and out’s of editing as a job. He discusses the collaborative process involved between an editor and a director. An editor should serve the director’s vision but also bring ideas of their own to the table. Murch also explains why he edits standing up— a quirk he has become known for. He mentions how to handle test screenings and their feedback. And finally, in the second edition of his book, he examines how digital editing has transformed the vocation. 

“In the Blink of an Eye” is an indispensable book not just for editors but for filmmakers generally. Though it was published decades ago, it continues to stand the test of time.

FILM PERMITS EXPLAINED

Guerilla filmmaking is much-romanticized– renegade directors fearlessly getting a shot no matter what rules are being broken. But in reality, some rules exist for a reason, and getting a film permit makes sense for both you and your crew and the general public. In this video, we look at everything you need to know about film permits.

WHEN DO I NEED A FILM PERMIT

If your film has commercial value and is being shot on public property, you technically need a permit. This refers to a wide swath of production-types, including music videos, short films, and of course features and TV. And film permits aren’t just for public property. In LA and much of its surrounding jurisdictions, you need a permit for private property as well.

WHAT IS IN A FILM PERMIT

Say you need a film permit. What information is required from you? The first is money– yes, unfortunately permits have a fee. This fee, however, changes depending on the nature of the production and the location in which you’re shooting. You will also be required to have production insurance. If you’re not sure what kind of insurance is appropriate, or how to get it, usually you can talk with the local permitting office. Of course, you’ll also need to provide details on the shoot, such as dates and time, equipment being used, and so on.

HOW TO GET A FILM PERMIT

Film permits aren’t hard to obtain if you have all your ducks in a row. Make sure you apply for a permit early, both to know you’ve secured a location and to make time for any potential delays in approval. You should also be sure the permitting office you’re dealing with actually has jurisdiction over the location you want to shoot on.

Permitting is crucial to having a smooth shoot. You don’t want to have your day halted, your equipment seized, or your production to be fined. Better to cross your T’s and dot your I’s.

DUNE PART 2 EXPLAINED

“Dune” has long been a deadly siren for filmmakers. The scifi classic proved to be a vexing task of adaptation for filmmakers as legendary as David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky. But in 2021, Denis Villeneuve cracked the code to the legendary text. “Dune Part One” was a critical and commercial success, kickstarting a new instantly-beloved franchise.

So it should come as no surprise that hopes were high for the second installment. Few films would be able to live up the expectations “Dune Part Two” was saddled with, but the movie has passed with flying colors. In this video, we look at what went into the “Dune” sequel.

DUNE PART TWO CINEMATOGRAPHY

As with its predecessor, “Dune 2” has impressive cinematography. Director of photography Greg Fraser returned for the sequel, but he didn’t simply run back the same plays from “Part 1.” For “Part 2,” Fraser opted to use more spherical lenses than the anamorphics he used repeatedly throughout “Part 1.” He re-housed old lenses, and detuned them to counter the hyper-sharpness of the Alexa sensors he was shooting on.

Fraser primarily used telescopic lenses for “Dune 2,” hoping that their crushed perspective would add to a feeling of suspicion and suspense. Of course, most notably, Fraser and Villeneuve decided to shoot Giedi Prime in infrared. The bold choice created stark imagery that made the planet feel all the more menacing and alien.

MAKING OF DUNE 2 PRODUCTION DESIGN

A huge element of the “Dune Part Two” visual palette is production design. PD Patrice Vermette pulled inspiration from all over the world to make each setting feel unique and real. Vermette built the look of Arrakis in the deserts of Jordan and the UAE. He wanted to forefront nature, since the Fremen’s relationship with the natural world is vital to the story. For Geidi Prime, Vermette pulled from the brutalist architecture movement.

DUNE VISUAL EFFECTS

“Dune 2” relied on a combination of visual and practical effects. The show-stopping scene where Paul Atreides rides a sandworm is testament to the marriage of these two approaches. The scene took almost forty days to shoot, and Vermette created a massive moving platform to simulate the worm. The end result speaks for itself.

“Dune 2” takes what was working in “Dune 1” and improves upon it. The grand storytelling, the epic vistas, the detailed settings– it’s all here. Denis Villeneuve and his team spared no expense and cut no corners. If our expectations were high for “Dune Part 2,” they’re even higher for “Dune Messiah.” Only time will tell if the director can match them.

VFX VS CGI VS SFX

There is a debate raging in the film industry. Well, there are multiple debates raging in the film industry, but today we’re focusing on one of them: VFX vs CGI vs SFX. This debate is rooted in confusion over definitions, and CGI fatigue. Certain audiences, and filmmakers, are tired of CGI being used as a creative bandaid, sloppily solving problems in post which allows for laziness on set. In this video, we dive head first into this debate, and find that the answers aren’t as clear-cut as they might seem…

WHAT IS SFX?

First, we look at the oldest of the three categories: SFX, short for special effects. Special effects refer to any elements created on set, also referred to as practical effects. When a filmmaker brags about doing some crazy visual “for real,” this is what they’re referring to. Today, SFX have become coveted, and even fetishized. See any Tom Cruise interview.

WHAT IS VFX?

Now, the second oldest: VFX, or visual effects. These are any effects added to imagery that was captured during production. This can be compositing, green screens, virtual production, motion capture, paint outs, and much more. VFX today are mostly done digitally, but a visual effect can also be executed without a computer. Old compositing techniques with optical printers count as VFX.
Now, here’s where the confusion can occur.

WHAT IS CGI?

CGI, or computer generated imagery, is a type of visual effect. But not all visual effects are CGI. CGI only refers to elements that are created solely using a computer. Seems pretty straightforward, right? The confusion arises from when filmmakers boast that their film didn’t use any CGI. People will quickly look at film’s credits, see all these VFX artists’ names, and claim that the filmmaker is lying. But actually, these VFX artists might be working on other VFX that don’t include CGI.

PRACTICAL VS DIGITAL

So why are more and more filmmakers emphasizing they aren’t using CGI? The answer lies in the evolution of filmmaking over the past 30 years. CG has become more and more dominant. And while this allows for creatives to build worlds never before thought possible, it can also result in less-than-stellar visuals and lazy filmmaking. But this is only when CGI is used poorly– it’s not an indictment of the tool. In the end, CG will always have its place in film. It’s just what that place looks like that may change.

MOVIE FREEZE FRAMES

For a while in the 1970s and 80s, freeze frames were all the rage. But the technique quickly became hackneyed and widely mocked, with everyone and their mother parodying freeze frames like the one in The Breakfast Club. But today, the frame hold is far from dead. In this episode of Ultimate Guide, we look at the divisive editing trick.

FREEZE AND STILL FRAMES AT BEGINNINGS AND ENDS

The most common place to see a freeze frame is at the beginning or end of a film. A well-utilized frame hold can start a movie with a bang. Think of the Tarantino freeze frame introduction effect. The frame hold at the top of Pulp Fiction is instantly iconic– a powerful blend of image and music. Freezes as endings can be just as memorable. Landing on the right frame can have a powerful impact. It can act as a final farewell (Thelma and Louise) or an open-ended question (400 Blows).

FILM FREEZE FRAMES FOR PACING

By definition, a frame hold affects the pacing of a cut. This can serve a variety of purposes. A freeze can emphasize a character’s expression, or a particularly important emotional beat. Or, it can be used more logistically, allowing for a voice over or piece of music to line up with the sequence. You’ll see this a lot in Martin Scorsese freeze frames, where he’ll halt a shot to give the narrator some time to explain what’s happening.

FREEZE FRAME AS EMPHASIS

No matter how you use a frame hold, it will draw attention. This is why the technique can be so controversial– use it incorrectly and no one can ignore it. But used well, it can allow an audience to absorb visual information they might have missed, or catch a small reaction that otherwise would have gone under the radar.

Freeze frames shouldn’t be relegated to the margins of history. There’s far too much the technique can offer. While there are certainly some laughable examples out there, there are far more great freezes that we won’t be forgetting any time soon.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TV WRITERS

Traditionally, film is regarded as the director’s medium, and television is the writer’s. While much about TV and film has changed since this wisdom was minted, it still holds true that a great TV show requires great writing. In the previous Anatomy of a Screenplay episodes, we focused on television’s older sibling, film. Now, we look at the TV script formatting and structural conventions that go into the small screen.

HOW TO WRITE A TV SHOW SCRIPT FORMAT

First, it’s important to note that television formatting isn’t that different from film formatting. Most things, in fact, remain the same. Dialogue, scene headings, action—all these conventions are identical, at least for single-camera TV shows (more on that in a minute).

The one big difference is act headings. Most movies have an act structure, but their screenplays do not explicitly delineate where acts begin and end. TV scripts, however, do. Often bolded and underlined, a writer will mark the act’s start and completion. This is because TV writing has traditionally been made to fit in between commercial breaks, which take place in act breaks. That said, now that commercials are less relevant with streamers and cable, some TV writers have stopped noting act breaks. 

MULTI-CAMERA TV WRITING 101

TV script formatting is very different for multi-camera shows (sitcoms like Friends or The Big Bang Theory). Dialogue is double-spaced, scene numbers are marked differently, and characters involved in a scene are listed under the heading. Additionally, there are “story days,” which tell crew members what day in the narrative a scene is, signaling costume changes, etc. This formatting results in these TV scripts running way longer than the typical page-per-minute rule — a 25-minute episode is about sixty pages.

TELEVISION WRITING STRUCTURE

Television writing is very different from film when it comes to structure. Most films have three acts. Drama television shows have 5-6 acts, each lasting about 10 pages. Half-hour shows vary as well. 30 Rock, for example, has two acts. A problem is presented in Act 1 and is resolved in Act 2. Other shows, meanwhile, have a more conventional 3-act structure. Where the TV show will air will affect how many acts you have.

Ultimately, a great TV show has a compelling story with memorable characters. This has to be present, no matter the format or screening context. But when getting your foot in the door, ensuring your script follows the right structural and formatting rules is crucial.

THE ILLUSION OF LIFE, EXPLAINED

In this episode of the Shot List, we break down the 12 principles of animation, how they work, and why animators continue to use them to this day.

APPLY THE 12 PRINCIPLES OF ANIMATION

Squash and Stretch: Deforming objects or characters to emphasize their weight, elasticity, or flexibility.

Anticipation: Preparing the audience for an upcoming action by showing a brief movement or change in expression. 

Staging: Presenting ideas or actions in a clear and visually interesting way, directing the audience's attention to convey the intended message.

Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose: Two different approaches to animating movement. Straight ahead animates each frame in sequence, while pose to pose plans key poses first.

Follow Through and Overlapping Action: Continuing movement after the main action stops and parts of a character or object moving at different speeds or times. 

Slow In and Slow Out: Gradually increasing or decreasing the speed of movement at the beginning and end of an action. 

Arcs: Animating objects and characters along curved trajectories, mimicking real-world motion.

Secondary Action: Additional movements that complement the main action, adding depth and context to a character's performance.

Timing: The speed and rhythm of movements in animation, essential for conveying weight, energy, and emotion effectively.

Exaggeration: Pushing movements and expressions beyond reality to make them more dynamic and expressive.

Solid Drawing: Creating characters and objects with volume, weight, and dimensionality, making animation appear more believable and three-dimensional.

Appeal: Making characters and animation visually interesting and appealing, designing characters with unique personalities and maintaining consistency in design and performance.

TO BE OR NOT TO BE A FILM STUDENT

The eternal question: is film school worth it? Unfortunately, there is no one clear-cut answer (that’s why the question is eternal). Each filmmaker’s path is unique, with some utilizing their film programs to catapult them to success and others forging their own way without higher film education. But this doesn’t mean you should just flip a coin.

FILM SCHOOL TUITION

If we’re being honest, money is the foremost consideration when it comes to deciding whether or not to go to film school. The top film schools in the country are, for the most part, expensive. Think long and hard about whether or not you want to be in a ton of student debt entering an industry which is infamously difficult to make a living in.

But it’s not all gloom and doom. Some programs, like state schools, are a bit less expensive. And this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re lower quality. Also, film school may be expensive, but so is college generally. Some programs might be slightly more costly than their liberal arts counterparts, but typically not by much.

WHAT WILL I LEARN IN FILM SCHOOL?

So you think you want to spend the money. But what, exactly, will you learn? Film school curriculum can largely be divided into two camps: how and why. The how is obvious: how to light a shot, how to budget a production, etc.. This is all important, but equally important is the why. Where do these lighting conventions come from? Why have they developed the way they have? And so on. Film studies focuses more on the theory and history of film.

FILM SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND CONNECTIONS

How many times have you heard this? “Film is about who you know.” Well, it’s a cliche because it’s true. This is perhaps the biggest perks of film school– you will meet other filmmakers who will likely become valuable connections and collaborators down the line. This is vital. Look at famous collaborators. Often, they met in school.

Film school isn’t for everyone. But it can also be an enriching experience that can do wonders for your career. The decision comes down to you. What do you need, and how will you get it?

FILM DISTRIBUTION PROCESS

It’s no secret that making a movie is hard. From writing to finding financing to shooting to editing, each step along the way has its own difficulties and potential pitfalls. Say you manage to power through each of these stages and you end up with a final product you’re proud of. First: congratulations. Second: prepare yourself– there’s much more work to come. Welcome to distribution.

WHAT IS DISTRIBUTION FILM?

In this video, we take a look at the final hurdle in the filmmaking process, distribution. Many filmmakers understand much of what goes into pre-production, production, and post-production, but when it comes to distribution, they are left befuddled and overwhelmed. To put it simply, distribution is the process in which a movie gets in front of an audience.

INDIE FILM DISTRIBUTION EXPLAINED

Obtaining distribution is never a guarantee. This is the process called acquisition, where a movie goes from a filmmaker’s hands to a distributor’s. Distributors come in many shapes and sizes, and we take a look at how to decide which type of distribution company is right for you. There’s no one answer, and there’s no one way to attract a distribution company. But one thing is always true: it’s never too early to start thinking about the process. Even in development, a filmmaker can consider what their audience may be and how they will reach them.

MODELS OF FILM DISTRIBUTION LICENSING

Once you’ve found a distributor, it’s time for the lawyer to get involved (if they aren’t already). Distribution comes with some form of licensing, where the distributor has the film’s rights transferred over to them. This is a complex exchange, and a filmmaker needs to make sure they have all of their copyrights and chains of title in order before they embark on it. Again, it’s best to lawyer up.

EXHIBITION

Exhibition takes many forms, from showing a movie to a group of friends on a TV, to a wide theatrical release. This is an area in the industry that is constantly changing, and today, it’s changing fast. Streaming, theatrical, and more are all finding their way in a new media landscape. For a filmmaker, this means keeping an open mind and going where they think the best opportunities are.

Distribution can feel like a wild rodeo, where you’re bucked this way and that before you settle into the saddle. Just keep your goal in mind: to show off the project you’ve worked so hard on. And if you make some money off of it, that’s great too.

LIGHT METER FOR BEGINNERS

In the age of digital filmmaking, it may seem like light meters are a thing of the past. Today, digital cameras often have massive dynamic ranges, allowing for a videographer to more easily cover up exposure mistakes in post-production. But most truly great cinematographers use light deliberately and precisely– and to do that, you need a light meter.

SPOT METER VS LIGHT METER

Light meters primarily fall into two categories: incident and reflective. Incident light meters measure the light falling onto the subject. Reflective light meters, on the other hand, measure light reflected off the subject back to the meter. They are also referred to as spot meters, since they measure more specific areas in a frame.

LIGHT METERING

Using a light meter goes beyond just getting the exposure right. It ensures the cinematographer’s visual intent is realized, maintaining continuity across different scenes and setups. Light meters help cinematographers make informed decisions about lighting setups, filter needs, and camera settings, preventing expensive post-production corrections.

HOW TO USE A LIGHT METER FOR FILM

For a light meter to do any of these things, of course, you need to know how to use it. Your process will vary depending on the meter you’re using. For incident meters, position the meter where the subject will be, pointing towards the camera, to measure the direct light. For reflective meters, point the meter toward the subject from the direction of the camera.

Mastering light meters enables cinematographers to craft visually stunning films with intention and precision. From choosing the right type of meter to understanding its application in various lighting conditions, a light meter is an invaluable tool in the cinematographer's toolkit, whether you’re shooting film or digital.

THE RULE OF 3 EXPLAINED

Good things come in threes, and nowhere is this more true than in writing. Since ancient times, writers and storytellers have used rules of three to create satisfying narratives. One time is an isolated incident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern. In this video, we break down the many uses of the rule of three.

RULE OF THREE COMEDY AND DIALOGUE

In dialogue, the rule of three manifests as a rhythmic device that enhances the impact of speech. A character may list three reasons to justify a decision, or a persuasive argument might be structured in three parts, each reinforcing the speaker's point. This is often called a tricolon.

Comedic dialogue, meanwhile, often relies on setting up two similar ideas before delivering a punchline with the third, creating a pattern that primes audiences for the joke and enhances its impact. This technique leverages the element of surprise within a familiar structure, making the humor more effective.

NARRATIVE FUNCTIONS RULE OF THREE

Within the narrative, the rule of three provides a framework that feels both complete and satisfying. The classic three-act structure— setup, confrontation, and resolution— guides audiences through a coherent journey that mirrors life's trials, victories, and growth. 

The rule of three can also be found in conflict. There are, you guessed it, three degrees of conflict: internal, interpersonal, and external. Using a mix of all three of these can give a narrative more variety and depth.

CHARACTER RULE OF THREE EXPLAINED

First and foremost, the rule of three is used in character dynamics. A group of three primary characters provides the potential for love triangles, power struggles, and more.

The rule of three also applies to how a character reveals themself to the audience. There are three layers to a character: what they show the world, what they show close friends and family, and what they only reveal to themselves. Deciding when and how to show these layers is crucial for a writer.
The rule of three is a testament to mankind’s affinity for patterns, providing a structure that enhances storytelling across dialogue, narrative, and character. Whether through the strategic delivery of a joke, the pacing of a plot, or the depth of a protagonist, the principle remains a cornerstone of compelling storytelling.

POOR THINGS YORGOS LANTHIMOS

A new Yorgos Lanthimos film is always an event. Whatever you think of his films, they’re never boring, and Poor Things is no exception. In this video, we look at how the Greek director approached his most recent project, from cinematography to production design to costuming.

POOR THINGS CINEMATOGRAPHY

Poor Things saw Lanthimos re-teaming with director of photography Robbie Ryan, and the two set out to push the customary Lanthimos style to new limits. Seeing Poor Things, few would argue that this goal wasn’t achieved. Through unexpected and experimental lens choices, as well as distinctive approaches to color and lighting, Ryan and Lanthimos created a unique visual palette for a truly unique story.

POOR THINGS MAKING OF PRODUCTION DESIGN

Part of what makes Poor Things such a visual feast is also its production design, overseen by PDs Shona Heath and James Price. The two department heads worked together to build massive sets so that CG could be kept at a minimum. The end result was incredibly detailed and period-accurate settings, each with a distinct flavor that corresponded with the city they were representing.

YORGOS LANTHIMOS MAKEUP AND COSTUME DESIGN

Speaking of visual feast. The costume design in Poor Things is second to none, with Bella’s outfits in particular acting as scene-stealers. The costumes were created by Holly Waddington, who took a fresh approach to Victorian-era fashion. Instead of restrictive corsets, Waddington opted for more liberating poofy dresses that were both playful and eye-popping. Makeup artist Nadia Stacey took a complimentary approach, refraining from using much makeup for Bella at all.

POOR THINGS FACTS

While the vision certainly begins at the top, Yorgos Lanthimos’ aesthetic is brought to life by his accomplished team. Nowhere is this more evident than in Poor Things, where Lanthimos’ hyperstylization is on full display.

FILM MARKETING STRATEGIES — THE ULTIMATE GUIDE

Film marketing is a key process in the lifecycle of a film. After all that creativity, blood, sweat, tears, and money spent to make it, it could all go to waste if no one goes to see it. A good film marketing strategy will get people into seats on opening day, while a bad one will do the opposite. In this video, we will dive into the business of marketing a film to the public.

WHAT IS FILM MARKETING

Film marketing can take many forms, but the sole purpose of all of it is to raise awareness and generate anticipation for an upcoming film. With today’s media landscape, there are countless campaigns for film and beyond vying for our attention. But with a clever angle or just pure luck, film marketing can break through the noise and reach millions.

Film marketing is expensive, and even the biggest projects with the biggest budgets must be strategic about marketing a film. 

TYPES OF FILM MARKETING

In the old days, film marketing was limited to trailers, newspaper ads, and radio. Today, you can find innovative movie marketing online with social media content, television commercials, billboards, and bus and bus stop signage. 

There are three main types of film marketing: paid media, earned media, and owned media. Paid media is when a production company or distribution company spends money on advertising (what we traditionally call film marketing). Earned media is any word-of-mouth advertising or critic reviews that cost nothing to the campaign. Owned media is everything at the disposal of the production company, like using different branches within a media conglomerate to advertise a film.

No matter the film marketing strategy or budget, every project has to compete for our attention and our dollars. And when you understand the film marketing machine, you have a competitive edge for running a successful campaign.

THE FIRST TEN PAGES

There are a lot of screenplays out there waiting to be made, so getting a potential producer or financier to read your script is a big accomplishment. But getting them to finish your script is a whole other animal. 

Scripts that get noticed are typically scripts that have strong openings, openings which tell a reader why they should keep reading. Within the first 10 pages, a screenplay should already have delivered a lot of information. In this video, we look at some of the strongest opening ten pages from famous screenplays, and see what they can teach us about writing a great hook.

HOW TO WRITE A SCRIPT’S OPENING

When screenwriting, it is important to know your tone. Are you writing a comedy? If so, what kind of comedy? A satire? Black comedy? Dramedy? Once you’ve answered this question, make sure you infuse your opening with that tone. Think of some of the best comedies out there. Nearly all of them establish their humor right off the bat, and certainly within the first ten pages. The same goes for other genres. A horror will typically have a scare right up front.

Of course, it’s also a good idea to introduce your primary characters in the first ten pages of a script. There are more exceptions to this rule than with tone setting, but by and large, screenplays will establish important character within their opening pages. This is more than just having a character appear. It is also showing the reader who this character is– how they act, think, and inhabit their setting.

HOW TO START A MOVIE SCRIPT

Speaking of setting, most great screenplay opening pages will establish a sense of place. If it’s a sci-fi, a screenwriter may introduce us to the rules of the alien world. If it’s a grounded drama, the screenwriter might note details in familiar settings that feel both real and telling.

Some first ten pages will also set up themes that will be investigated in the rest of a script. If one theme is the value of community, the first ten pages might have a character deliberately eschewing his comrades and going it alone.

In this vein, setting the stakes is also crucial. What will happen if a character doesn’t succeed? In Jurassic Park, for example, David Koepp opens on a worker getting eaten by a dinosaur. The stakes are clear: fail, and get eaten.

SCREENWRITING ADVICE

Your first ten pages may not include all of these elements. It may even only incorporate a few of them. But no matter what, the first ten pages of a screenplay should be intriguing. The reader should want to know more. If you don’t accomplish this goal, the stakes are as stark as Jurassic Park’s: your script might get put down.

You’ve got a film you worked hard on and are proud of. Now it’s time to submit to festivals. But entering the film festival ring for the first time can be overwhelming. It can seem like everyone knows the secret tips and tricks to getting in and getting noticed. In this video, we demystify the film festival process, and give you strategies to navigate the circus.

IMPORTANCE OF FILM FESTIVALS

Looking at the steep submission fees for fests, you may wonder if you need a festival run at all. So before you submit, it’s important to know what festivals can actually do for you. The most valuable commodity for the majority of fests is networking. Most reputable organizations will draw a crowd of industry members, and all organizations will draw a crowd of filmmakers. These meet and greets are indispensable.

If you’re lucky enough to get a feature into a top tier festival like Sundance or Cannes, you may also have a chance at distribution. This is much harder to achieve, however, if you aren’t at one of the Big Five.

TIPS FOR SUBMITTING TO FILM FESTIVALS

If you think the festival route is the path for you, it’s time to decide on which festivals to submit to. This requires a lot of research– you don’t want to waste money by applying to fests indiscriminately. When making your choices, there are a few factors to take into account. First, look at the past winners. Are they similar to your film? Where are they now? If it seems like the festival takes movies like yours and can elevate your career, then that’s a good festival to apply to.

GETTING INTO FILM FESTIVALS

Now comes the hard part. There’s no one way to ensure your movie will get into all your top picks, but there are certain things you can do to give yourself a better chance. Most obviously, your film should be good. For most fests, this means unique– is it saying something different in a different way? It also means professional quality, sound mixed, colored, etc.

Film festivals may feel daunting, but if you submit to the right place, they can work wonders for both your film and your career.

4 TYPES OF CHARACTERS IN A STORY (OR FILM)

All characters are not created equal — and they shouldn’t be. Not every character needs to be multidimensional and have a clear character arc. A good writer knows the four types of characters and how best to use them in any given story. Flat, round, static, and dynamic characters can be found everywhere, and the sooner you understand how they work, the better writer you’ll be. In this video, we’ll break down these character types, what makes them unique, and how they can even share these categories. 

FLAT VS ROUND CHARACTERS

The first pair of characters are flat or round. This has nothing to do with their physical shape but thinking of them this way does help keep their differences in mind. Flat characters are uncomplicated and often defined by a single character trait. They are often used for supporting characters, comic relief, as a sort of stereotypical character, or when a character’s personality is deliberately simple. Round characters, on the other hand, have more dimension. They’re complicated, have layers to them, and are most often seen in protagonists. 

DYNAMIC VS STATIC CHARACTERS

One of the most commonly heard screenwriting mantras is that characters must change. What they really mean is the “main character” must change — no one is upset when a side character who is only in one scene doesn’t have a complete character arc. Dynamic characters are those that undergo some degree of change throughout the story. Again, most protagonists are dynamic, but there are still exceptions to that “rule.” Static characters, on the opposite side, change very little or not at all. 
Antagonists are often static because they need to provide the hero with consistent conflict. 

Remember, while there’s no overlap within each pair (e.g., characters are either flat or round), they can be combined between the pairs. A static character can either be flat or round, for example. The types of characters at a writer’s disposal allow them to enrich their storytelling with variety and depth.

LEARN POST PRODUCTION

You’re just catching your breath from a demanding shoot. You’re on your last legs but you did it; you got everything you needed in the can. It’s time for post production.

POST PRODUCTION 101

The first step in post-production is picture editing. This is where the footage is placed together in a deliberate order, and it is completed by an editor. The editor is aided by an assistant editor (or multiple assistant editors) who helps organize footage. The editor will work through the cut in stages – first the assembly, then the rough cut, the fine cut, and finally, the final cut. 

ADDITIONAL VISUALS IN THE POST PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

Nowadays, there is often visual effects work to be done. This isn’t relegated to just sci-fi and fantasy projects; VFX are all over almost every movie and TV show today. The process is overseen by the VFX supervisor.

Next up is coloring which is conducted by the colorist, who typically works very closely with the cinematographer and director to get footage looking right. A colorist has two primary jobs. First, they color correct, then there’s color grading, where the coloring can become more stylized.

AUDIO POST PRODUCTION PROCESS WORKFLOW IN FILM

Sound is overseen by the supervising sound editor. First is sound editing, where all the sounds are put in place. There’s also music, which has a team including a composer, music supervisor, music editor, and more. Once all the sounds are recorded and in place, it all needs to be mixed together by the re-recording mixer.

As you can see, there’s a lot of work that goes into post-production, and it can be a lengthy process involving hundreds of people. But it’s worth putting the time and money into it. Post-production makes or breaks a movie.

MOVIES THAT USE PERSPECTIVE

All movies have a point of view. A truly objective film, one independent of personal opinion or emotion, is impossible. A filmmaker’s viewpoint will always be present. Even if a movie is a single, locked off shot, the filmmaker chooses when to begin and end the shot, where to place the camera, how to light the scene, and so on.

But filmmakers can also emulate the perspective of their movie’s character, creating sequences that are colored by a character’s subjectivity. In this video, we break down why this is so important and how it can be achieved.

SUBJECTIVITY IN WRITING 

Subjectivity can begin on the page. Most screenwriting textbooks will preach objectivity, instructing writers to only write what the camera can see. But, when done deliberately, infusing subjectivity into the script can hint at a director to shoot from a specific point of view. We look at the scripts for May December, Pirates of the Caribbean, and more to see how one can write from a character’s perspective without necessarily breaking screenwriting rules. 

SUBJECTIVE CINEMATOGRAPHY

Probably the most obvious form of subjective cinematography is the point of view shot. This is where the camera is literally representing what a character is seeing. But not all subjective camera work needs to be so obvious.

A director of photography can use camera movement, lens choices, color, and shot size to subtly inhabit a character’s subjectivity. Think, for example, of a shot where a character is stressed. To emphasize this stress, the cinematographer may opt for a handheld, shaky camera, as can be seen in The Killer.

EDITING SUBJECTIVITY IN FILM

Editing can further place an audience in a character’s head. Think of the iconic slow motion shot when Richie sees Margot in The Royal Tenenbaums– by slowing the footage and placing a wistful song under it, the editor effectively makes us feel as entranced as Richie. Special effects can be used as well. In Midsommar, subtle distortion effects are used to show us what Dani is seeing after she consumes the mushrooms. 

Subjectivity in film is incredibly powerful. Using writing, cinematography, and editing, a filmmaker can get an audience to empathize with a character they may be nothing like. This is one of the great promises of filmmaking, exposing audiences to new worlds and viewpoints. The next time you start filming, think about what your character might be thinking and how you could use filmmaking techniques to illustrate those thoughts.

CAR VIDEOGRAPHY

Movies love cars. Think of all the great car scenes throughout cinema history, from The French Connection to Mad Max. But filming a car scene can be exceedingly difficult. Shooting in a moving vehicle immediately introduces dangers that aren’t present on most sets. The first lesson for anyone trying to film a car scene: prioritize safety. No car scene is worth endangering your cast and crew. With that in mind, there are a few different considerations for a vehicular sequence.

CAMERA PLACEMENT IN A CAR SCENE

One of the primary challenges for a car scene is the lack of space. There are limited areas for a camera to be placed. One way around this is the process trailer, a low level truck bed that can carry the picture car. Not only does this give the crew space around the car to place the camera, but it also means that the actor doesn’t actually have to drive. A cheaper version of this is the tow rig, where a car is essentially being towed. This removes much of the space available to the crew, but still ensures an actor doesn’t have to focus on driving.

If a car is actually being driven, a camera can be placed on a hostess tray. The lighting, camera, and audio will all be monitored in a lead car, which stays close to the picture car throughout filming and acts as a mobile video village.

HOW TO LIGHT A CAR

The other consideration for shooting car scenes, of course, is lighting. Here, space is also an issue. A crew may rig chasing lights to the side of the car to add the feel of pacing street lights, or they may hide lights within the car. 

Lighting can be far more controlled when utilizing the Poor Man’s Process. This is where a car is placed in front of a green screen or virtual production LED to simulate movement. Here, the crew can move lights outside the car. This option is by far the safest and can also be the simplest. 

Contrary to its name, however, it may not be the cheapest option, since moving lights or a virtual production screen can cost money.

HOW TO SHOOT A CAR SCENE WITH AUDIO

Sound is also a consideration. With the Poor Man’s Process, sound can be treated as it would be in any other scene. But when the car is actually moving, there’s a lot of background noise to contend with. Typically, a production sound mixer will hide lavs in a car’s visor, since this will naturally point them at the actor’s mouth. It should be noted, however, that getting pristine audio in a moving car is nearly impossible– you’ll have to do clean up in post.

Car scenes can be difficult, but when done well, they can be dynamic and visually exciting.

MAKING OF KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON

Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is unlike anything the legendary director has made before. And yet the film is also a culmination of Scorsese’s favorite genres and techniques, all blended together in a seamless epic about the original American sin. In this video, we break down the breathtaking visuals that comprise Scorsese’s latest masterpiece.

KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON VISUALS

First, we look at the camera and lens choices Scorsese and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto made to accomplish Killers’ distinct style. Prieto and Scorsese opted for the Arricam LT and Arricam ST film cameras for most scenes. For daytime sequences, they shot on Kodak 5207 stock; while for the nighttime shots were on Kodak 5219.

For even darker scenes, Prieto switched to a Sony Venice digital camera, which performs better in lowlight. For the opening sequence, Prieto shot on an antique Bell and Howell hand-crank camera, which Scorsese already owned.

As for lenses, the duo opted for the anamorphic Panavision T-Series. Prieto felt these wide lenses were fitting for the flat landscape of Oklahoma. For the funereal shots of murdered Osage members, Prieto shot on a custom anamorphic Petzval lens, which is an extremely old piece of glass that gave the footage an antique feel.

KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON LIGHTING BREAKDOWN

Killers of the Flower Moon’s plot line is a journey into the heart of darkness, and Prieto wanted to represent this with the film’s lighting. For Osage-oriented scenes, Prieto shot using naturalistic light, emphasizing their connection to the land. As the film progresses and gets more and more bleak, the lighting gets harsher and more contrasty. This evolution was aided by Prieto’s choice in LUT. For the beginning of the movie, he used a LUT mimicking autochrome, an old color treatment. Near the end, he transitioned to ENR, which has less saturation and more contrast.

The lighting in Killers isn’t always naturalistic. There are certain scenes where Scorsese and Prieto went for more experimental imagery. These are some of the most striking images in the film, including Mollie’s sister’s death and Ernest staring out at burning crops.

KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON VISUAL EFFECTS

Scorsese’s number one priority when talking with VFX supervisor Pablo Helman was to have any VFX work be invisible. In other words, he never wanted it to call attention to itself.

As such, there is VFX throughout the film, but you wouldn’t know it. The VFX team primarily worked on expanding sets and matching the town’s look to historical photographs. But they also touched up actors, making the poisoned Osage women look sicker as time went on.

Killers of the Flower Moon is a testament to attention to detail, and a master of his craft working at the top of his game.

FILM PRODUCTION FOR BEGINNERS

Making a film is difficult, and each step of the filmmaking process comes with its own difficulties, but the production stage is perhaps the most exhausting. Production can test the mettle of even the most seasoned filmmaker.

Film production, also known as principal photography, is when footage is captured for a film. It is often one of the briefer stages, since a budget can quickly skyrocket the longer it runs. For an indie film, production may not last longer than a couple weeks.

We talk to director Tamra Davis (Billy Madison, Half Baked), DP Jarin Blashke (The Northman, The Lighthouse), and 2nd AD Pete Dress (No Country for Old Men, King Richard) to get their insights into how to survive production.

PLANNING THE FILM PRODUCTION PROCESS

The majority of planning for production occurs during pre-production, but production is a constantly morphing entity, so planning continues until the last day. These logistics are overseen by the production department, including the line producer and the production manager, who ensure that things on set are going off without a hitch.

The first and second assistant directors are responsible for making sure the crew stays on time and within budget. They also create the call sheets for each day, which outlines who needs to be where when. 

THE SETTING UP PROCESS OF FILMMAKING

The camera doesn’t simply start rolling when the crew’s rolled out of bed and shown up on set. The grip department will oversee any rigging that is necessary for a scene, including camera rigs and light rigs. But the grip department doesn’t deal with the actual lights themselves; that is overseen by the gaffer.

Meanwhile, the production designer and set dresser make sure that the set is ready for filming. The actors will get prepped by the makeup department, and put into their outfit by the costume department. The actors will then go through blocking with the director.

SHOOTING IN FILM PRODUCTION

When it’s time for cameras to roll, the assistant director will call for quiet on set, and the production sound mixer and camera operator will start rolling. The clapper loader will slate, and the director will call “Action.” To end the take, the director will then say cut.
Then everyone rinses and repeats– going on until the crew has got enough footage for a movie.

SLOW MOTION CINEMATOGRAPHY

Sometimes, you need to take things slow. Filmmakers have been employing this piece of wisdom throughout cinema’s history with slow motion. In this video, we look at the myriad of applications slow motion can have. Slow motion shots in movies don’t have to be hyper-stylized or distracting– they can subtly enhance the quality of a story, and evoke a specific mood.

HOW TO MAKE SLOW MOTION VIDEO

Before we delve into its uses, it’s important to know how slow motion is achieved. Typically, a cinematographer will get a slow mo shot by “overcranking”– shooting at a frame rate above the base frame rate of the movie. Most films have a baseline frame rate of 24 frames per second, so to achieve a slow motion shot, a filmmaker will have to film at a rate above 24 fps. This means that when the footage is played back at 24 fps, the action will appear to move more slowly. The higher the frame rate, the slower the playback (120 will look slower than 96, for example).

SLOW MOTION IN CINEMATOGRAPHY FOR ACTION

Perhaps the most popular approach to slow motion cinematography is in action movies. A slomo shot can make an action sequence more digestible. If we look at the use of slow motion in Untouchables, we can see that it allows Brian DePalma to show us what is happening in a complex, and brief, sequence that he is able to stretch out. Of course, slow motion video can also heighten the spectacle of an action scene. This is the preferred method of filmmakers like Zack Snyder and John Woo.

SLOW MOTION VIDEO FOR DRAMA

Slomo can also emphasize a dramatic moment. Wes Anderson, about as far from Snyder or Woo as you can get, uses slow motion frequently to emphasize a feeling. This can be particularly affecting when paired with the perfect song, as Anderson has shown us time and time again. Similarly, slow motion can be great for portraying an actor in a flattering light. Think about how many times we’ve seen a character’s love interest shown in slow motion to represent their infatuation.

EXPERIMENTAL SLOW MOTION VISUAL STORYTELLING

Slow motion comes from filmmakers experimenting with the form. So it should come as no surprise that many avant garde filmmakers use the tool. Surrealists like Jean Vigo and Jean Cocteau would use slomo frequently to create worlds that feel far separated from our own. Today’s most famous surrealist David Lynch also uses slow motion, typically to emphasize the unsettling and/or uncanny qualities in his images.

As our video illustrates, slow motion cinematography is chameleonic, fitting for movies across all genres. The key is to use it with purpose.

THE ANATOMY OF A SCREENPLAY PART 2

Screenwriting has countless conventions, from formatting dialogue to describing a setting. Typically, screenwriters have to squeeze their creativity into these rules, finding ways to remain original while adhering to a structure that can be easily understood and read. This is because for a screenplay, readability is paramount. The basic elements of a script are there so that any cast and crew member can quickly comprehend what is going on in a scene. 

But there are some elements of a screenplay that aren’t so simple. We look at screenplays by the likes of Aaron Sorkin, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Tony Gilroy, and Phoebe Waller Bridges to see how legendary writers format unconventional elements of a screenplay.

MOVIE SCRIPT FORMAT FOR AUDIO

The most obvious sound that a screenplay clearly outlines is dialogue. But even this aspect of the anatomy of a screenplay can take different forms. Take a phone conversation, for example. Depending on how the writer sees the conversation being depicted, talking on the phone can be represented a multitude of ways on the page.

Interruptions, too, can take different forms. Some writers will use a dash, some writers two dashes, and others a forward slash. There’s also dual dialogue, where actors are talking over each other. Of course, language, too, has to be taken into account. Different writers have different methods for formatting foreign language elements of a screenplay.

HOW TO WRITE A SCRIPT WITH GRAPHICS/TEXT

More and more often, movies have on screen text to represent digital communication between characters. This can be done in countless different visual ways. Likewise, there is no one rule for representing texts in a script. The same goes for signage. Some writers will depict what a sign says in all caps, others will bold it, others will write it like any other words in action lines.
ELEMENTS OF A FILM SCRIPT: PLOT DEVICES

There are concrete rules for how to tell a linear, conventional story in screenwriting. But when that story becomes non-linear, things get a little more nebulous. Take flashbacks, for example. Some may write “insert flashback,” others just “flashback,” and others might not even note it. The same goes for dream sequences and quick successions of shots. 

Despite its plethora of rules, screenwriting is an artform. There may be some formatting conventions you have to follow so that your script doesn’t get tossed in the trash by an overworked reader, but there are others you can bend to your own creative ends.

STAGES OF FILMMAKING — THE PRE-PRODUCTION PROCESS EXPLAINED

Before the cameras start rolling on any film set, there must be extensive planning. This stage is called the pre production process. In this episode, we go through everything you need to know about movie pre production, with the help of assistant director Donald Sparks and production designer Jason Kisvarday. They walk us through the many elements of pre production: budgeting, scheduling, script breakdowns, crew hiring, storyboarding, location scouting, and much more.

WHAT IS PRE PRODUCTION IN FILM

One of the most important aspects of movie pre production is scheduling. Scheduling and budgeting are closely intertwined in the stages of pre production in film. How long you’ll shoot is directly related to how much money you have. So how do you schedule a movie? It all begins with a script breakdown, where an AD analyzes a script for all relevant production details. Once this is done, the AD will take cast, crew, equipment rentals and more into account when crafting the shoot schedule.

HIRING CREW IN THE PRE PRODUCTION PROCESS

Of course, a movie usually requires the work of more than one person. During the pre production process in film, most of the roles in the crew are filled. This usually begins with department heads, like the cinematographer, costume designer, production designer, and stunt coordinator. These heads will often then hire for their own departments, and convey their needs to the line producer. At the same time, the cast that wasn’t already attached in the development process is brought on board by the casting director.

MOVIE PRE PRODUCTION PRE-VISUALIZING

During pre production, the director will work with their team to plan the look of the movie. They may shot list and/or storyboard with a cinematographer, and have meetings with other department heads like the production designer and costume designer. They will also conduct location scouts and, later, tech scouts. Camera tests may also occur, so that the technical aspects of the film are locked down before filming begins.

Pre production is both demanding and vital. The more thorough you are in pre production, the higher your chances of success down the line in the filmmaking process.

Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer currently stands as the highest-earning biopic in history. Having the birth of the atomic bomb as subject matter certainly doesn’t hurt, but it was arguably Nolan’s filmmaking craft that pushed this film to such heights. In this video, we’re breaking down the making of Oppenheimer, including the cinematography, practical effects, and non-linear structure, to see if we can’t understand the mechanics of its success.

OPPENHEIMER CINEMATOGRAPHY

Working again with DP Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan shot Oppenheimer on large-format film. This included 5-perf 65mm and 70mm film, IMAX (15-perf 70mm) in color and B&W. There was also a priority to shoot everything practically, with the only computer assistance being the compositing together of practical elements. The result is a film with the highest resolution possible of a rather intimate and subjective character study.

VISUAL EFFECTS IN OPPENHEIMER

Nolan and his team went out of their way to shoot everything in-camera. This included the vibrating backgrounds during Oppenheimer’s anxiety-ridden speech — achieved by projecting the background onto itself to create the effect. Oppenheimer’s visions were done with a combination of cloud tanks, practical lights, macro lenses, and varying frame rates. The nuclear explosion was an achievement in itself — perhaps the closest to an actual atomic blast without resorting to the real thing.

THE STRUCTURE OF OPPENHEIMER

If you’ve seen the film, you know it jumps back and forth between two main narrative threads — one following Oppenheimer and the other tracking Strauss. This non-linear structure was always the intent as Nolan wrote the script following this basic format, but editor Jennifer Lame also came with fresh eyes. She was able to hone the structure into a cohesive whole to make a 3-hour film of mostly people talking feel as tense as a train heading for a cliff.

With these filmmaking tools and artisans at his disposal, Christopher Nolan orchestrated one of the most visually stunning, gripping, and morally compelling films of recent memory.

ARISTOTLE’S POETICS EXPLAINED

Whether they’re aware of it or not, storytellers have been influenced by Aristotle’s Poetics for centuries. In the philosopher’s text, one of the first dedicated to literary theory, Aristotle lays out the groundwork for what he believes should be in every story. In this video, we will break down Poetics by Aristotle, hoping that writers can understand where these storytelling conventions come from and how they might use them in their own work.

WHAT IS ARISTOTLE’S POETICS

Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was a Greek philosopher who shared his thoughts and theories on everything from politics, art, science, economics, and philosophy. Poetics is the earliest surviving work of Greek literary theory. Aristotle uses the text to argue for specific elements of storytelling, specifically those that apply to tragic storytelling. Today, writers working in tragedy or not still borrow specific notions from Poetics, and its influence cannot be understated.

THEORY OF TRAGEDY

Aristotle presents the following hierarchy of importance to elements that should be included in a story: plot, character, thought, diction, spectacle, and song.

Plot — For Aristotle, this is the most critical aspect of a story. He argues they should have a beginning, middle, and end, along with crucial story beats like peripeteia (reversal of fortune), anagnorisis (critical discovery), and catharsis (emotional relief). He also argues that plots should hinge on causality, where each event leads directly to the next and creates a cohesive narrative.

Character — In general, Aristotle believes that characters should essentially be good. They may dabble in moral gray areas, but their intentions and goals should be righteous.

Thought — Stories should make the audience think and draw connections between what is happening in the story and how we live our own lives. Today, we might understand this as the “theme” of the story. 

Diction — Aristotle also valued elements of diction, including word choice, grammatical decisions, and sentence structure. In other words, they should be well-written. 

Spectacle — This is primarily focused on the story's presentation to heighten the drama in the text. For example, a typical conversation around contemporary films is how spectacle overshadows the plot and characters. 

Song — Musical accompaniment has been a part of theater and film productions from their beginnings. And while music does enhance the storytelling, it is still at the bottom of Aristotle’s list.

Aristotle’s Poetics is a fascinating text to study — some of it is outdated, but knowing how and why we tell stories the way we do is valuable knowledge for any storyteller.

HOW TO WRITE AN INCITING INCIDENT

Most screenplays have something that kickstarts the story, otherwise known as the inciting incident. Some stories depend on a clear and dramatic inciting incident while others can occur without the audience even realizing it. There is no right or wrong way to do it — whatever works best for your screenplay. In this video, we’re breaking down how to write an inciting incident.

WHAT IS AN INCITING INCIDENT

The inciting incident definition is quite simple — an event that sets the story in motion. It can be as big and dramatic as the shark’s first kill in Jaws, or it can be barely noticeable like characters meeting for the first time in movies like When Harry Met Sally. Either way, this event steers the course of the narrative thereafter. Writer K.M. Weiland likens it to the first domino to fall.

TYPES OF INCITING INCIDENTS

Of course, since every story is different, there are different types of inciting incidents. There is no formula to it but certain genres often employ the same story catalysts. Rom-Coms, for example, are known for the “meet-cute” where the couple meets for the first time. Horror movies will often use an initial clue that evil is present. For dramas, a personal loss or death of someone dear is a strong type of inciting incident. No matter what type you choose, it should have an irrevocable effect on the character and plot.

WHERE DOES THE INCITING INCIDENT GO?

There are always exceptions to the rule but most inciting incidents mark the halfway point in Act One. This is after we’ve met the main characters, and been familiarized with their world. If we take the basic three act structure where the story is divided into quarters, this means the inciting incident should occur roughly 12.5% into the screenplay. 

These are just the basics on how to write an inciting incident. Once you know your characters and the story you’re trying to tell, it’s all a matter of finding the right beat to send them on their journey.

Select from various commonly used storyboard arrows to clarify character and camera movements.

Storyboard arrows and text are two ways many professional storyboard artists annotate their storyboards. The purpose of these annotations is to add layers of clarifying detail so that the shot can be communicated to the relevant departments.

The primary function of storyboard arrows is to communicate movement. This could include character movement, camera movement, or any other element in the frame. Since storyboards are static and films are in motion, they require these extra details to capture the intended movements in a shot.

In StudioBinder, adding storyboard arrows is a cinch. With the built-in feature, any image can be annotated with storyboard arrows, which can be moved, resized, flipped, and many other modifications to help you lock your storyboard in.

HOW TO MAKE A BIOPIC

Hollywood loves spectacular stories, regardless of whether they’re born out of the imagination or taken from real life. In fact, the biopic (biographical picture) has been a staple of filmmaking from the beginning. In this video, we will let some of the best filmmakers share their philosophies and insights into what makes a great biopic, including their approaches to writing, casting, and directing.

HOW TO WRITE A BIOPIC

Perhaps the first step in writing a biopic is deciding the timeframe of your subject’s life. In some cases, their entire life might be summed up in a 2-hour film, and in other cases, it could be a single event. Then, the writer must decide how to frame the subject — perhaps to mythologize an unknown historical figure or humanize a larger-than-life musician.

BIOPIC CASTING

For most biopics, casting the right actor for the role is a balancing act between matching the physical appearance and capturing the essence of the subject. For example, Oliver Stone cast Anthony Hopkins in Nixon because of his ability to give the audience access to an otherwise inscrutable figure. For Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan took an interesting approach by casting A-list actors in roles with little screen time in order to give those minor characters dramatic weight in the story instantly.

HOW TO DIRECT A BIOPIC

Even though a real story about a real person is what we expect from a biopic, their stories don’t always have to be given a realistic presentation. Some filmmakers, like Spike Lee, for his biopic Malcolm X, wanted to use film language to give the film an epic quality. On the other hand, when Spielberg directed Schindler’s List, he wanted a more personal, grounded experience and avoided some of the most sensational techniques from his previous work.

Biopic movies are sometimes written off as formulaic or “awards bait,” but it’s all in how you approach the task. There is just as much opportunity to tell the same spectacular stories that audiences crave using material from the world around us. What makes a great biopic is a team of filmmakers who understand their subject and the cinematic language necessary to tell their story.

STAGES OF FILMMAKING — DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCING IN FILM

How does a movie actually get made? In this series, we’re walking through the process, one step at a time. In this episode, we’re kicking it off with development and financing in film. Along the way, we will have producer Alex Saks offering insight into the process, how development works in film, how to raise money for a movie, packaging a film, and more. 

HOW DEVELOPMENT WORKS IN FILM

Obviously, the first step in any film is the idea itself. But where do ideas come from? Scripts are born in a number of ways, including spec scripts written by the writer without any guarantee of being made. Another way producers look for material is through existing intellectual property (IP) like books, magazine articles, video games, or even theme park attractions. No matter the source, the screenplay should be in tip-top shape before it moves onto the next step: financing.

FILM FINANCING 101

One of the biggest hurdles in filmmaking is money. For all its creativity, cinema is equal parts business. Movies are expensive to make, market and distribute, but, when done well, can reap millions for the investors. Every project is a gamble so it’s no surprise that getting money for a project can be difficult, even for studios and A-list stars.

Film funding can be divided into two general categories: studio financing and independent financing. For bigger studio projects, there are established avenues and investors involved. However, since those budgets are typically much higher, the risk involved is still high. For indie filmmakers, it can be more difficult to find funding, even though their budgets are comparatively lower and they have less chance being seen and/or making their money back.

While this may be the most difficult stage of a film’s lifespan, with a great idea and some savvy financial partners, anything is possible.

THE MAKING OF THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT

In 1999, the horror genre was once again growing stagnant. Then a small indie film called The Blair Witch Project came to Sundance and caused quite a stir. In this video, we take a look back at the making of The Blair Witch Project — from its unusual filming process to its marketing campaign that had (most) people fooled that it was all real.

How The Blair Witch Project was filmed is quite the story. With an initial budget of $35,000, directors Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez took three actors into the woods, gave them cameras, and a rough outline of what was supposed to happen. To capture an authentic “found footage” look and feel, the actors operated the cameras themselves and improvised their dialogue. The filmmakers left notes for the actors to find using GPS, all while they monitored the filming from afar.

There was no locked script, so Myrick and Sánchez would watch dailies and make adjustments for the next day. This would include notes to the actors on their performance and story beats to pursue.

For shooting, there were two cameras utilized — a Hi8 video camcorder and a 16mm film camera. To record sound, they used a DAT recorder, which, like the cameras, was operated by the actors. The result is a truly authentic experience — they could shoot in 360 degrees with not a crew member in sight.

When they entered the editing room, the process was the same as any other documentary. This involved sifting through hours of footage and finding the right pacing, emotional beats, and tension. If the camera was extra shaky in a particular moment, but the performance was great, they’d leave it in.

THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT PUBLICITY STUNT

The Blair Witch Project marketing campaign will go down as one of the best. The basic premise of the campaign was that the film was literally found footage and that the filmmakers had been missing for five years. In other words, it was all real. A website was created for people to learn more about the mystery of the missing filmmakers. And it worked — many people believed this narrative, and it built an immeasurable amount of intrigue for people wanting to see the footage.

Released in the summer, The Blair Witch Project would go on to become the most profitable independent film up to that point. It terrified audiences, became a cultural phenomenon, and kickstarted the found footage trend that continues to this day.

SOFIA COPPOLA DIRECTING STYLE

Watching the films of Sofia Coppola, one often finds themselves in a certain mood, from the composed and dreamy visuals to the soundtracks that put us into a trance. A consistent story motif in her work deals with isolation — what happens to characters who find themselves isolated or face the possibility of isolation. In this video, we will dissect the Sofia Coppola directing style into elements like cinematography, editing, and sound design to unlock how Coppola constructs this concept and mood.

The most obvious way Sofia Coppola movies present isolation is on a plot level. In The Virgin Suicides, the Lisbon sisters are isolated on house arrest while the group of love-struck neighborhood boys dream of them from afar. Charlotte and Bob are two lost souls who find common ground in the maze of Tokyo. Some characters are trapped in a location, some are trapped in their indecisions, and some are dealing with both quandaries simultaneously.

With production design, Sofia Coppola continues this theme of isolation. For example, in The Beguiled, a group of women are stranded in a schoolhouse during the Civil War. The costumes and set dressing provide subtle clues without clunky exposition. Their dresses are faded, and obvious alterations have been made since they are unable to leave to buy new clothes. Vines grow up the walls of the house while the yard is choked with overgrowth.

Coppola also uses color to separate characters from the worlds around them. In The Bling Ring, the domestic homelife of the teenage thieves is drowned in muted beige palettes while their criminal nightlife bursts with vibrant hues. With cinematography, Coppola will often shoot at a distance from her characters, with abundant negative space in the frame to visually isolate them.

In films like Somewhere, the editing is minimal, allowing scenes to play out in real-time to help put the audience into the same “going nowhere” headspace of the characters. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, we can see how the subjective montage edits in The Virgin Suicides capture the romantic memories of the Lisbon girls.

Finally, the sound and music elements that Coppola is mostly known for. In some cases, the sound design is extra quiet. So much so that we can hear the pull of a cigarette or water dripping into a bathtub. Coppola’s music choices range from daydream melancholy to heartwrenching ballads and everything in between. Their purpose is to put us in the characters' heads so that we can feel the isolation with them.

Few filmmakers can create an introspective mood or dreamy headspace like Sofia Coppola. All of us have felt lost or alone, which is why these small, intimate portraits of similar individuals resonate.

WHAT IS HAMARTIA IN STORYTELLING (AND HOW TO WRITE IT)

To varying degrees, all characters should have faults. These can be minor problems that provide more superficial obstacles, or they can be major weaknesses that bring forth a character’s downfall. In this video, we will look at these more serious, tragic flaws, what Aristotle dubbed hamartia. What is hamartia, how does it work in storytelling, and what are some of the ways writers can use it to create tragic characters? Let’s find out.

WHAT IS HAMARTIA?

In his seminal work on tragedy, Poetics, the great thinker Aristotle lays out this idea that at the center of a tragic character’s downfall is a critical flaw in their behavior or how they think. At the time, the Greeks believed hamartia was a work of fate or karma. Either way, it is often manifested as a mistake, an oversight, a blind spot, a willful ignorance, etc.

EXAMPLES OF TRAGIC FLAW

Aristotle wrote about contemporary Greek tragedies, but we can see hamartia throughout storytelling since then. Dr. Frankenstein’s tragic flaw is his blind confidence in scientific progress and a lack of foresight regarding the consequences of playing God. In There Will Be Blood, Daniel Plainview’s hamartia is tied directly to his greed.

Hamlet’s indecision plunges him into despair. In Black Swan, Nina’s insatiable drive for perfection leads her to self-destruction. And in the Coen Brothers' satirical comedy Burn After Reading, each character in the ensemble has a tragic flaw that contributes to their own demise.

HOW TO WRITE A TRAGIC FLAW

The tragic flaw itself can be various, but there are some strategies writers use to make them work, no matter the character, genre, or story. For one, the consequences of their hamartia must be shown. In any tragedy, the aftermath is where the real resonance occurs — it is the payoff following the setup that audiences expect.

Second, a character’s hamartia should be central to the story. In the Black Swan example, the plot finds Nina pursuing the lead role in Swan Lake, which perfectly sets the stage for her insecurities and obsessions to take hold. Finally, a good tip on how to write hamartia is to allow the characters a chance to overcome their tragic flaw. Since hamartia is more than simply “bad luck,” it is important that the fate of the characters hinges upon the decisions they make. 

Not every story is a tragedy, but writers who understand the power and function of hamartia are able to apply similar aspects while crafting rich and nuanced stories.

BARBIE BEHIND THE SCENES

The smash hit of 2023, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, proves that high-concept comedy is alive and well. Beyond the witty script and solid performances, one of the many marvels of the film is the production design. Barbieland is the epitome of what Gerwig calls “authentic artificiality,” and in this video, we will look at the making of Barbie, where they drew inspiration from, and how they captured all of it on camera.

INSPIRATION BEHIND THE MAKING OF BARBIE

Naturally, the decades of Barbie dolls, vehicles, and dreamhouses provided much of the inspiration for Barbie Land. But Production Designer Sarah Greenwood and Set Decorator Katie Spencer went above and beyond the original Mattel IP. The quest became how to visualize Barbie’s world to feel both foreign and familiar, fake and real at the same time. Inspired by Technicolor classics like The Wizard of Oz, the decision to shoot on a soundstage helped Gerwig and her team achieve these qualities. Color palettes were made to conform with the established Barbie aesthetics with additional inspiration from musicals by Jacques Demy, like The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.

The architectural style was borrowed from mid-century California, specifically Palm Springs and the pool from the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Weird Barbie’s house is a nod to Boo Radley’s house in To Kill a Mockingbird and the Bates house in Psycho.

MAKING OF BARBIE — BUILDING THE WORLD

The making of Barbie Land was quite a feat. First, they needed to find the perfect shade of pink. Once they did (Rosco Fluorescent pink mixed with white), they had to scour the globe to find enough of it to paint the set. No black, white, or chrome was used in the production design — until the Kens took over and completely changed the dynamics of Barbie Land.

The sky backdrop stretched 800 feet long and 50 feet high and was hand-painted. Greenwood played with perspective and built many of the props and sets 23% smaller to capture the same relationship between the Barbie dolls and their dreamhouses.

There are many reasons why Barbie is memorable, but the production design should be near the top. With a creative team spearheaded by Greta Gerwig, it should be no wonder that Barbie behind the scenes is just as interesting as the film itself.

DIRECTING ACTORS PT. 2

In a previous episode, we heard from some of the best film directors about how to direct actors. In this video, we’ve assembled even more directors with even more nuggets of wisdom on directing actors. Topics covered include writing for specific actors, casting, preparation and backstory, and the inner workings of working with actors on set.

WRITING AND CASTING

Some directors are also writers, so the question becomes, do you write for specific actors or not? Wong Kar-Wai says he prefers to customize the role for the actor to maximize their strengths. Nancy Meyers will keep photos of her actors nearby to help get her unstuck while writing. Other directors like Pedro Almodóvar like to keep the screenplay “pure” and then find the right actors for each part.

HOW DIRECTORS WORK WITH ACTORS TO PREPARE

Directing actors can begin long before they step onto the set. Working with actors in the preparation phase can take many forms. Richard Linklater likes to work with actors in rehearsal to make the actual performances on camera feel spontaneous. Guillermo del Toro likes to provide his actors with extensive and detailed character descriptions. Filmmakers like Robert Eggers, who has so far worked in period films, will often give his actors primary sources to research the history of the time period.

HOW TO DIRECT ACTORS ON SET

After the casting and rehearsal stages are complete, there’s nothing else to do but get on set and do it for real. Famously, David Fincher likes to do a lot of takes to get his actors so comfortable with the material, that it feels like second nature. On the other hand, filmmakers like Michelangelo Antonioni prefer only three or four takes per shot to keep the actors fresh. The atmosphere on set is also a critical factor. Jonathan Demme advises to keep the actors as comfortable as possible on set. 

Hopefully, these lessons resonate with any beginning filmmakers trying to understand the craft. The lesson here is that the best answer to how to direct actors comes from you and how you work best.

COMING OF AGE MOVIES EXPLAINED

When we think of great coming of age movies, we often think of teenagers entering adulthood. But this ignores many of the obstacles we experience after that. In his book, “Save the Cat Goes to the Movies,” author Blake Snyder lays down the three main elements of this Rites of Passage subgenre. In this video, we will investigate these underrated coming of age movies, the five types that cover a spectrum of life obstacles, and how they work in a spectrum of stories.

TYPES OF COMING OF AGE MOVIES

Snyder posits that there are five categories that make up his Rites of Passage subgenre: Adolescence, Addiction, Mid-Life, Separation, and Death. In each case, characters enter into situations that force them to change, to accept themselves as they are, and to show us how we might also navigate such troublesome waters.

3 ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN RITES OF PASSAGE FILMS

First, Snyder explains that each character must be faced with the problem. Depending on the subtype, this could be peer pressure, substance abuse, divorce, a mid-life crisis, or even death. This problem is often one without an easy solution and, so, the protagonist often embarks on an ill-conceived plan to solve it. This “wrong way” is the second element, taking up much of Act Two, and merely delays the inevitable.

The final element is the solution to the problem found through “acceptance.” This means accepting things like mortality, a fractured family, the underlying motivations fueling an addiction, or becoming comfortable in one’s own skin. All of it is a part of life — necessary change as we move through the stages of modern existence.

The best coming of age movies have the power to reach anyone and everyone in the audience. As Snyder explains, the draw of this subgenre is just how universal these issues are and how the solutions can be conveyed to us with the right combination of drama, struggle, and revelation.

DAVID LYNCH DIRECTING STYLE

There is no filmmaker quite like David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Twin Peaks, Eraserhead). An artist in every sense of the word, David Lynch makes movies that are equal parts evocative and abstract. He thrives on mystery, and his films are intuitive puzzles that are difficult to solve but spark our imaginations nonetheless. In this video, we will sink into the depths of David Lynch’s unbounded consciousness by examining seven different aspects of his directing style. We can’t solve these puzzles, but we aim to help you solve them for yourself.

DAVID LYNCH EXPLAINED

At their core, much of what we see in David Lynch movies is centered on duality. This concept is expressed in both the worlds of his films and also within the characters themselves. The world is both violent and beautiful, strange and familiar. We also see many examples of doppelgangers where this division between good and evil can be literally manifested.

There are many ways to interpret David Lynch films, but there are more objective techniques we can point to that might help us understand them a bit more. David Lynch is a big fan of mystery in film — questions that get posed that activate the audience’s imagination. He calls this “dreaming.” So, what about the David Lynch directing style makes the audience dream? We found two things in particular: fragmentation and abstraction. 

Fragmentation means that there are gaps in the story and things left unexplained. For example, in Lost Highway, we are presented with two realities in which Renee and Alice are the same person, or Alice is merely a projection. It is up to the individual audience members to figure it out for themselves. The other technique is abstraction, where themes or concepts are represented in abstract forms. For example, Jack Fisk who portrayed The Man in the Planet from Eraserhead claims that the levers his character operates are meant to represent karma.

As David Lynch himself explains, these movies aren’t meant to be understood but felt. This makes sense when you know that his creative process follows a similar route. Lynch “feels” his way through the writing, directing, photographing, sound designing, and scoring — following his intuition instead of any sense of strict logic. Dreams are subjective, and the dreaming we do watching David Lynch movies is equally so.

THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE PAN SHOT & TILT SHOT IN FILM

Cinematography literally means “writing with movement” — this applies to the movement of actors but also to the movement of the camera. The most basic and fundamental camera movement in film is either a panning shot or a tilting shot. But just because the pan shot and tilt shot are foundational techniques doesn’t make them any less intricate or effective. In this video, we will demonstrate the various techniques and considerations one should take with the tilting shot or panning shots in film.

WHAT IS A PAN SHOT & WHAT IS A TILT SHOT

First things first, what is a pan shot, and what is a tilt shot? Panning in film refers to a horizontal movement of the camera on a stationary axis (left and right). Tilting in film refers to a vertical movement of the camera on a stationary axis (up and down). In these pure examples, the camera itself doesn’t move from its location, it simply adjusts the angle of view. But in many cases, a pan shot or a tilt shot will be combined with a dolly forward or backward or a boom up or down to create even more dynamic camera movements.

TYPES OF CAMERA MOVEMENT 

Panning in film is great for revealing a location or landscape with a more horizontal orientation. Likewise, a tilting shot works best to reveal tall buildings or characters from their feet up. The speed of the movement, as well as the degree of movement, are both important elements. A slow pan/tilt shot can instantly generate suspense — what is about to be revealed?! A fast pan/tilt shot creates momentum between two frames that a cut can’t usually accomplish. 

PANNING AND TILTING IN FILM MEETS BLOCKING & STAGING

A tilt up shot or a panning shot in film can also be choreographed with the blocking of the actors. In many cases, the movements mirror each other — the camera pans left to right, following the character across the room. This helps focus the viewer’s attention on the character’s actions, and it can also help put us in their frame of mind as we move with them.

Whether it's a slight pan to the right or a big tilt up to the sky, these simple camera movements play a huge role in visual storytelling. And with a firm grasp of these techniques, your next project can benefit.

JANUSZ KAMIŃSKI CINEMATOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES

Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński is one of the best DPs working today. While he’s mostly known through his decades of collaboration with Steven Spielberg, he’s also done stellar work with directors like Camerone Crowe, James L. Brooks, Julian Schnabel, and Judd Apatow. In this video, we’re going to take a look at Kamiński’s style with a focus on his use of lighting, color, and gear to enhance his visual storytelling.

JANUSZ KAMIŃSKI STYLE — LIGHTING

Kamiński has a distinctive style when it comes to lighting. In particular, he loves to use backlighting to create high contrast imagery for a darker atmosphere. One example we can point to is how he lit The Lost World compared to how Dean Cundey shot Jurassic Park. The first film often kept the dinosaurs fully lit while Kamiński’s sequel opted to keep them more shadowed and more terrifying.

JANUSZ KAMIŃSKI STYLE — COLOR

Color is another element in Kamiński’s style that guides the mood of a particular scene or film. The lack of color in Schindler’s List doesn’t just emulate B&W WWII footage, it keeps us grounded in the horrors of the Holocaust. For Minority Report, Kamiński found a balance between a look that was futuristic yet familiar and “very gritty and full of gray.” In Munich, different color palettes were used to separate distinct locations.

JANUSZ KAMIŃSKI STYLE — EQUIPMENT

Cameras and lenses used also contribute to Kamiński’s style. As he explains, different stories from different eras require different considerations when it comes to gear. For Saving Private Ryan, modern lenses were stripped of their protective coatings to avoid an anachronistic look. For Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, anamorphic lenses and soft filters helped imbue the film with a nostalgic, classical Hollywood patina. 

Looking at the last few decades of Janusz Kamiński cinematography, it’s no wonder a filmmaker like Spielberg has stuck with him. His range is extensive and his ability to find the visual language for a particular story is unrivaled.

CHARACTER FOILS EXPLAINED

If you’ve ever noticed that some pairs of characters complement each other perfectly, you might actually be dealing “foil characters.” But what is a foil character? In this video, we’re going to break down how character foils are used in storytelling. We’ll also look at some examples of foil characters in popular movies like Star Wars, Inside Out, and The Great Gatsby.

WHAT IS A FOIL CHARACTER

A foil is anything in a story that reflects or brings out another aspect of the story. This could be a setting or subplot but more often than not it refers to a character. A foil character exhibits traits that illuminate or reinforce contrasting aspects of another character, usually the protagonist. For example, Dr. Watson is a foil character for Sherlock Holmes — Watson’s penchant for following the rules contrasts with Holmes’ more rebellious approach.

TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF FOIL CHARACTERS IN MOVIES

There are countless examples of foil characters in movies and they can be broken down into some general subtypes. First is the mentor foil, like Mr. Miyagi for Daniel, who exhibits certain attributes that the apprentice aspires to emulate. Then there are ethical foils, like Black Panther and Killmonger, who have contrasting views of right and wrong. Emotional foils, like Sadness and Joy in Inside Out, who possess emotional depth or aspects the protagonist is missing. There are even class foils, like Bob Cratchit and Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, where social classes become integral for the character development and/or theme of the story.

When you sit down to write a foil character, think about opposites and how they help define and enhance your characters and their character arcs. Or use your foil characters to speak to the larger ideas at the core of the story. Whatever the purpose, good writers know that the main objective of foil characters is to help give their protagonists more depth and complexity.

HOW TO DIRECT ACTORS FOR FILM

Ask ten directors on how to direct a film and you’ll get ten different answers. While there is no surefire answer to how to direct actors, there are strategies and approaches to consider. In this video, we’ve collected words of wisdom from some of the best film directors, past and present, on their specific approaches to directing actors. Topics covered include the casting and rehearsal processes, giving notes, and the importance of allowing for spontaneity on set.

DIRECTING STARTS WITH CASTING AND REHEARSAL

There is an adage in filmmaking that “directing is 90% casting.” Some directors, like the Coens, rely on the audition process to ensure that the actor is actually right for the part. Jordan Peele admits that he hopes the actor will understand the character better than he can. Greta Gerwig values the rehearsal process to work out the more creative elements of a scene, while Spielberg chooses to save the spark of the performances for the set.

HOW TO GIVE DIRECTION WITH NOTES

A set can be a stressful place, and tensions are high for everyone involved. How to work with actors on set requires a special set of skills. As a young director, Ryan Coogler couldn’t help but be direct and honest with his actors. Tarantino agrees: “It’s about being specific about what you’re saying because if you’re arbitrary, they’re a fish looking for water.”  David Cronenberg likes to leave the actors alone as much as possible on set, having done all the prep ahead of time.

DIRECTING ACTORS & SPONTANEITY

Even with the weeks of pre-production and rehearsal, many directors advise leaving room for spontaneity. Directors like Kelly Reichardt embrace the variables that come into play when the uncontrollable elements influence the controlled elements. John Cassavetes was a huge advocate for improvisation, sometimes surprising his actors with notes and scenarios, capturing a more natural and unfiltered performance.

FILM CLAPPERBOARD EXPLAINED

The clapperboard is an essential film tool. In fact, filmmakers have been using them for over a century — no matter what technologies in cinema have come and gone, the clapperboard remains. But why? What is a clapperboard and why do filmmakers use them? In this video, we’re going to break it all down. From the basic and essential functions to how to mark the slate properly to the proper etiquette when using one on set.

WHAT IS A CLAPPERBOARD

The clapperboard, also known as a slate, is a highly functional tool in film and video production. At its core, it has two main roles — it helps keep all the footage organized and it is a way for editors to sync sound and picture during the post-production process. Written on the board is information for each take (or shot) during production. The editorial team then can quickly identify which shot is which when they assemble the film, often weeks or months later.

The second function involves syncing the sound to the picture. In a vast majority of cases, sound and image are recorded separately. The quickest way to synchronize them is to match the visual and the audio of the “sticks” making contact. 

HOW TO MARK THE SLATE PROPERLY

Most clapperboards contain the following information for the editorial team — names of the project, director, and DP; the camera roll or card number, the scene number, the take number, the fps and lens info, whether there is sound being recorded or not, if the scene is an interior or exterior, day or night, etc. All of this information is used by the editorial team to keep the footage organized and to cross reference the script supervisor’s notes on additional information for each shot.

When the camera and sound are rolling, the 2nd Assistant Camera holds the slate in front of the camera, making sure the information is visible. They call out the scene and take number to be recorded on the audio, and then they say, “mark.” At this point, they clap the sticks together to provide that sync point. Then the director calls action and the scene is recorded.

Without a tool like the clapperboard, an editorial team assembling a feature film with thousands of shots, and tens of thousands of takes would be absolutely lost. And with this proper etiquette in mind, you can now make your next project that much more organized and professional.

THE WHYDUNIT EXPLAINED

In many cases, detective movies are more concerned with collecting clues that will lead to the identity of the killer. This is your classic “Whodunit.” But in a slightly different form, the motive for the crime and the underlying psychology behind it takes center stage. This is what we call the “Whydunit.” In Save the Cat Goes to the Movies, author and screenwriter Blake Synder argues that there are three essential elements in the Whydunit. And in this video, we will explain each of those elements and how they play a part in some of the best detective movies.

TYPES OF THE WHYDUNIT

Snyder further breaks down this category into five distinct subcategories. The Film Noir Whydunit has the protagonist enter a shadow world only they can negotiate. The Political Whydunit uncovers the abuse of political or corporate power. Fantasy Whydunits are set in another world. The Cop Whydunit is as much about the lawman’s crime as it is about the criminal’s. And the Personal Whydunit follows a “civilian” on a case to save themselves or others. No matter the broad range of plots we find across these subtypes, they all exhibit three elements: the detective, the secret, and the dark turn.

THE DETECTIVE

But as Snyder explains, this doesn’t need to be a professional or private investigator — it could be anyone. In Brick, it is a high schooler searching for his ex-girlfriend’s murderer. The other quality Snyder finds in these detectives is a lack or complete absence of change. It is often not the detective who undergoes any significant change, but the audience might once they have explored the dark side of human behavior.

THE SECRET

That unknown question that drives the detective forward is the secret. It is a mystery so alluring that they might put themselves in great danger in order to solve it. In JFK, attorney Jim Garrison’s investigation into the JFK assassination puts a target on himself and his family. The secret may begin with a minor detail or insignificant clue, but its allure grows throughout the story.

THE DARK TURN

At some point, the detective in the Whydunit with make at least one dark turn, in which they willingly become part of the darkness. This turn will find them breaking their own rules because, as Snyder puts it, “the pull of the secret is too great.” In Blade Runner, Deckard falls in love with Rachel, a replicant like those he was hired to kill. 

Not all detective movies follow the same Whydunit formula, but some of the best do. Now we know the three elements that go into a Whydunit, but this is just the beginning. It’s up to writers like you to find new ways to wrap us up in the mystery.

THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO SUBTITLES IN FILM

These days, subtitles are becoming more and more a part of how we watch film, TV, and videos online. But despite their current popularity, subtitles have been a part of the motion picture medium from the beginning. In this video, we will explore the world of subtitles, including their history, the principles behind their effective use, and some creative ways they can contribute to visual storytelling. 

WHAT ARE SUBTITLES (AND WHERE DID THEY COME FROM)

In general, subtitles are any text that translates or transcribes dialogue, narration, or on-screen text. There are two distinct types of subtitles — intralingual and interlingual. Intralingual subtitles are transcriptions that are in the same language as the dialogue. Interlingual subtitles are translations from one language to another. There is also closed captioning which allows for the deaf and hard of hearing to get a sense of the soundtrack as well.

But this practice of adding text to an image actually pre-dates cinema. The slides used with magic lanterns could also include narration or dialogue cues for the presenter or audience to follow along with the story.

RULES FOR SUBTITLING — FORMAT & STYLES

Over time, the formatting and styling of subtitles has more or less become standardized. Some of these “rules” are basic common sense, like aligning the text during the actual dialogue and making sure the text appears long enough to be read. The rule of thumb here is no more than 17 characters of text per second of footage. It is also typical for there to be no more than 2 lines of text at a time and 50 characters per line.

But then there are the not-so-obvious rules that allow for an easier audience experience. Keeping syntactic units together, for example, like names, or making sure the start and stop points of the subtitles don’t interfere with the visuals and/or editing. And another rule of thumb is make sure subtitles are added only to what is necessary — if a line is repeated five times in a row, for example, you might only need to subtitle the first two or three lines.

CREATIVE USES OF MOVIE SUBTITLING

Beyond the technicals, there are also creative applications to consider. Comedy can spring from subtitles like in Austin Powers or Wayne’s World. Different languages in the same film can be color-coded to help the audience understand the nuances. And in films like John Wick, different fonts and layouts can give the subtitles flare and emphasis that actually build on the visual storytelling.

The art and science of subtitling is something we take for granted. Sometimes it’s easy to differentiate good subtitles vs bad subtitles but this is an area which all filmmakers should be thoughtful and considerate of their effect on the story and the audience.

THREE-ACT STRUCTURE EXPLAINED

If you’re a writer, hoping to be a writer or even a casual movie-goer, you’ve probably heard of three-act structure. More than simply “beginning, middle, and end,” three-act structure is dominant in Western storytelling. And in this video, we sat down with writer and story expert K.M. Weiland as she breaks down the eight parts of three-act structure, how they work, and what they aim to accomplish. To do this, Weiland dissects one of the best-structured movies of all time — Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, written by David Koepp based on a novel by Michael Crichton. 

WHAT IS THREE-ACT STRUCTURE

While the concept of a three-act structure is fairly recent, stories have followed this pattern for centuries. Act One introduces us to the characters, their world, and the major conflict. Act Two sees the characters set out to resolve that conflict and attain whatever goals were established in the previous act. Act Three contains the final test or confrontation that will decide the outcome of this pursuit with either success, failure, or something in between. In a nutshell, this is the structure that most stories, novels, films, TV shows, or any other narrative medium follow. 

DOES THREE-ACT STRUCTURE WORK?

Yes, it does, but not for every story. Shakespeare often constructed his plays in five acts. The three-act structure is ubiquitous in Western storytelling and, therefore, has, in some circles, garnered a negative reputation as being creatively restrictive. But as Weiland explains, story structure of any kind doesn’t preclude creativity — it is merely the container, and what is inside (the characters, the plot, the themes, etc.) is the real gift.

Learning three-act structure is a way to grasp the fundamentals of storytelling. That way, when bending or breaking those rules becomes necessary, it can be done without sabotaging a story’s chances of reaching and connecting with the audience.

THE ANATOMY OF A SCREENPLAY

The screenplay is a medium every knows but there is a lot more going on in this form than people realize. In this video, we’re going to look at the history of the screenplay, movie script format and why it’s important, and some creative exceptions that push the artform forward.

ELEMENTS OF A FILM SCRIPT

There are six basic elements in the anatomy of a film script and their format and function is 99% consistent from script to script. These include the scene heading, action/description, character, dialogue, parentheticals, and transitions. Scene headings denote the location and time of day a scene takes place, as well as whether it is an interior or exterior scene. The action/description provides all the non-dialogue storytelling — introducing characters, describing the action from beat to beat, etc. Character cues mark a specific character’s dialogue, which can be augmented with parentheticals for more direction on the delivery of the dialogue. And finally, transitions can be included to mark the definition switch between scenes, especially if that switch contains relevant storytelling material.

THE PURPOSE OF MOVIE SCRIPT FORMAT

The reason why movie script format is so uniform goes back to the days when making movies was more like a factory assembly line. This allows ADs and producers to accurately estimate critical information like budget and schedule. On average, each page of properly formatted script equals a minute of screentime. That page is then divided into 1/8ths to schedule each shooting day. 

For beginning writers, it is important to follow these “rules” because the people who decide whether to buy and/or produce your script expect “professionalism” and something familiar they can recognize an assess. If you hand in a script that follows none of these rules, your chances of it being read passed page one are slim to none.

You might have the best idea for a script but unless you understand the anatomy of a screenplay and the in’s and out’s of movie script format, it might never see the light of day.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE STUNTS EXPLAINED

It’s almost objectively true that Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible films have occupied the apex of jaw-dropping stunts for years. And now, with the 7th installment, Cruise and Co. have raised the bar…again. In this video, we had the honor of sitting down with Stunt Coordinator and 2nd Unit Director Wade Eastwood to discuss those insane Mission: Impossible stunts and the harrowing tales behind them.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE BEHIND THE SCENES — ROGUE NATION

We’ve all wondered what it would be like to hang on to the outside of an airplane mid-flight, right? Well, Tom Cruise actually did it. What’s really amazing about the Airbus sequence is that the crew had only two days to complete it — one for rigging and rehearsal, one for shooting. The only safety precautions were eye contacts to protect his eyes and a rope and harness to keep Cruise from falling to certain death. The underwater vault sequence required an entirely different set of skills. The biggest one was Cruise holding his breath for up to 6 minutes in the same shot.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE STUNTS BTS — FALLOUT

In the next film, Fallout, another plane is involved, but instead of hanging on, Cruise jumps out of it at an altitude of 25,000 feet. This was the now-iconic HALO jump, and Cruise became the first actor to complete it on camera. Because they shot it at dusk, the camera (strapped to another diver’s helmet) had a very limited depth of field which meant precise choreography and planning. In another sequence, Cruise piloted a helicopter himself during an alpine chase. To capture the actor and his surroundings, specially designed camera rigs were mounted to the helicopter. 

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE STUNTS — DEAD RECKONING

In this installment, the team pulled off what might be the most dangerous stunt yet. Cruise was tasked with driving a motorbike off of a cliff and then base-jumping into the canyon below. While that may not sound extreme, the number of variables and potential accidents made this a big “don’t try this at home” stunt. 

As Eastwood explains, the most impressive aspect of these Mission: Impossible stunts is that Tom Cruise also has to act in character while he’s piloting a helicopter or driving off of a cliff. The thrill that the audience experiences is uninterrupted by cutting away to a stunt double. These are the reasons why Mission: Impossible stunts are a cut above the rest.

When we take a look at Mission: Impossible behind the scenes and how Mission: Impossible stunts were filmed, we find a group of professionals pushing the limits on what's possible in film.

ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE SPLIT SCREEN

The split screen in film may seem like a modern invention. But, in fact, it goes back to the earliest days of cinema. For over a century, filmmakers have used the split screen effect for many purposes — some purely for stylish imagery, some for visual storytelling that would otherwise be impossible. In this video on the split screen, we’ll cover that history, some of the most creative examples, and how you can employ the same techniques in your next project.

WHAT IS A SPLIT SCREEN

In general, a split screen is any combination of shots presented simultaneously. We divide these into two categories: visible and invisible split screens. The visible split screen is what most people are familiar with, which involves a clear separation between the images with no intention of presenting them as a “single shot.” Invisible split screens, however, are meant to go unseen. This is done when an actor plays multiple roles in the same shot, or when filmmakers like David Fincher and Wes Anderson combine different takes of each character in a single shot.

HOW TO USE SPLIT SCREEN

We’ve identified a few uses for the split screen in film: to convey multiple perspectives, to create relationships between characters, to give montages visual flair, or to literally extend the frame like with systems like Cinerama. We can also see that a split diopter lens can be used to create a similar “split screen effect,” where the frame is divided not by a line but by two distinct focal planes. 

In all of these use cases, the split screen expands the visual information and storytelling opportunities beyond what a single image can do.

FILM TROPES EXPLAINED

One of the most pervasive complaints about movies is that they all seem the same. The repetitions we point to are called tropes, which have since been considered negative. But there is a reason why film tropes exist and why they work. In this video, we want to dispel the notion that film tropes are always bad and never good. We will also provide some creative solutions to achieve the best of both worlds — familiarity, and freshness.

WHAT ARE TROPES

From the original literary definition, a trope is the use of figurative language. But the more common understanding these days is that tropes are anything that recurs in a story, often to the point of overuse. Film tropes can be found in character types, plot points, dialogue, and imagery. 

CHARACTER FILM TROPES

Characters can easily become tropes. The Mad Scientist, the Bully, the Damsel in Distress — by name alone, these are recognizable character film tropes. When writers include these character tropes in their work, there is shorthand with the audience. But without tweaking those expectations in some way, the audience will notice.

PLOT FILM TROPES

Like characters, we can point to a number of recurring plot points, which are often genre-specific. Love triangles, dreams, the heroic sacrifice are just a few examples of plot tropes we’ve seen a thousand times. But, again, instead of rejecting these movie tropes outright, writers can embrace them as opportunities to challenge our expectations to create something new.

DIALOGUE FILM TROPES

Dialogue, too, is a common source of film tropes. How often have you heard lines like, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this” or “Don’t you die on me”? Because these lines are so overused, they can be repurposed for comedy instead of drama. 

IMAGERY FILM TROPES

Locations, like abandoned warehouses or idyllic suburbs, can be tropes. Walking away from an explosion is a recent trope, as is the overhead crane shot as someone dies. The imagery itself is familiar, which can be an economical way to communicate an idea, but audiences still require something more.

Film tropes are ever-present but also always evolving. The idea is to embrace what makes these tropes work and find a way to make them work again with slightly new or different elements.

HOW TO WRITE PLOT TWISTS

When executed well, plot twists in movies can be shocking and thrilling at the same time. The best pilot twist movies figured out how to deliver these reversals to the audience so they don’t feel cheated. Anyone can be revealed as the killer in the end, but writing plot twists that work requires thoughtful consideration, misdirection, and clues. In this video, we’ll look at some of the most compelling plot twists in movies and the three elements that every writer should consider when learning how to write the perfect plot twist.

WRITING PLOT TWISTS REQUIRES MISDIRECTION

A plot twist is when the storyteller flips reality on its head, presenting an unexpected truth that changes everything. Misdirection is a key element in how this is done — focusing the audience’s attention in one area while the truth is hidden in another. But there are unspoken rules when it comes to writing plot twists, the primary of which is that the big reveal needs to make logical sense. And to lay the groundwork for the plot twist to not feel like a cheat, the writer needs to incorporate clues, which we like to call breadcrumbs.

COMPELLING PLOT TWISTS HAVE CLUES

For a truly satisfying reversal, as we can see in the best plot twist movies, the writer and director should leave clues that are only apparent on a second viewing. Those tiny details that flew under the radar now appear to be so obvious in hindsight. This is easier said than done — since even the most casual movie-goer knows everything we see or hear is important. The trick is learning how to drop those breadcrumbs in such a way that the viewer can easily disregard them.

WHEN TO REVEAL THE PLOT TWIST

A final consideration is to decide when and where the big plot twist is revealed. Naturally, every story is different, so there is no “one size fits all” approach to structuring compelling plot twists. Some of the best plot twist movies flip the script at the midpoint when the last thing you expect is for the story to take a completely different direction. In many cases, the best plot twists are unveiled as a break into Act 3, propelling the story toward its climax. Some filmmakers save their shocking reveal for the very end, leaving the audience slack-jawed as the credits roll.

The art of a plot twist is a delicate balance between the amount of misdirection, the dispensing of clues, and where in the story the plot twist will have the greatest impact.

WHAT MAKES AN ANTIHERO

Traditionally, heroes are good, and villains are bad. But somewhere in the middle lay antiheroes — morally ambiguous characters that have only grown in popularity. But what makes an antihero so compelling? In this video, we will explain the murky antihero definition, explore some of the most iconic examples of antiheroes, and provide considerations for anyone interested in writing antiheroes.

WHAT IS AN ANTIHERO

Most people agree that an antihero is the main character in a story who simply lacks the qualities of a traditional hero. But, beyond that, the antihero definition is not set in stone. The boundaries that qualify this character type are subjective because they are based on our own sense of morality. 

In fact, we consider the antihero definition to be more of a spectrum, and where each character lands on that spectrum is a combination of our understanding (or sympathy) for them and how much we approve of their actions. The bad things an antihero does might seem justifiable for one person and inexcusable for another. The further toward “disapproval” a character goes, the closer they get to being labeled a “villain protagonist,” another category built on subjectivity.

WRITING ANTIHEROES

It should go without saying that writing antiheroes can be tricky. Unlike the well-established boundaries for what makes a hero and what makes a villain, writing antiheroes is a bit like walking a tightrope. Making them too sympathetic reduces their complexity, but making them not sympathetic enough might alienate the audience from engaging with them.

But there are considerations to keep in mind when writing antiheroes. The first is to give them a backstory or present actions that explain how this character has become who they are. The audience needs to understand or relate to these characters on some level. Another related technique that will help engage the audience with the character is using voiceover. Hearing the thoughts and feelings of the character is a common way to build rapport. 

Furthermore, it helps to give the character an internal conflict. This allows room to change or grow, but it also reminds us of our own moral quandaries. On the flip side, charisma is a great way to counteract any nastiness of the antihero. Likewise, the piece's tone is also a way to soften the harshness of these characters and their actions. And finally, if the character’s actions and behaviors are tied to the overall theme, it helps the audience understand their purpose.

The complexity and ambiguity of the antihero are perhaps what makes them such compelling characters. Hopefully, with these examples and techniques, you can navigate these morally ambiguous characters just as effectively.

JOHN WICK 4 BEHIND THE SCENES

In 2014, the first John Wick film burst onto the action scene with guns blazing. It instantly raised the bar for what action films could do — a feat surpassed by each successive entry in the franchise. The fourth chapter represents the pinnacle of this style, and in this video breakdown, we’re looking at John Wick 4 behind the scenes to see how they shot it. Specifically, how the stunts, cinematography, and VFX blend seamlessly to create realistic action in a stylized world.

JOHN WICK 4 CINEMATOGRAPHY

Two things are immediately apparent when studying John Wick cinematography — the steady and slow camera movement during action scenes and the preference for wide frames. This lends itself to a great tradition of fight scenes done “in-camera.” While most films opt for plenty of coverage and editing to construct the action, the John Wick filmmakers let the action choreography speak for itself. The fighting might be grounded in realism, but the lighting is hyper-stylized with bold, saturated colors.

JOHN WICK 4 VFX

To pull off the type of action we see in these films, VFX is both a safety concern and a time-saver. First, with so much weaponry, especially at close range, a lot of work needs to be done in post. This includes adding smoke and muzzle flares to prop guns, digitally creating throwing weapons like knives and axes, and, of course, the insane amount of blood effects. As explained in the video, if they had attempted this many blood effects practically, they would have gotten half the work done in the same amount of time.

JOHN WICK 4 STUNTS

You can’t have realistic action without realistic stunts. Former stuntman and stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski stepped into the director’s chair for the John Wick series (co-directing the first film and solo directing the rest). With Stahelski’s background, the stunts and action choreography could be done as realistically as possible — and when you have an action star like Keanu Reeves willing to do most of his own stunts and fights, you can’t go wrong. By knowing what’s possible, what looks good on camera, on where action choreography could be elevated, the John Wick films prove that action cinema is far from dead.

ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE TRACKING SHOT

There are many types of camera movement in cinema, but one in particular is perhaps the most common: the tracking shot. In this video, we will explore the art of the tracking shot in film, including the many considerations involved and how this camera movement adds to visual storytelling. 

WHAT IS A TRACKING SHOT

A tracking shot is any shot in which a camera independently follows one or more moving characters. This excludes similar shots like a pan or tilt where the camera is otherwise stationary. A camera moving through a location with multiple characters also doesn’t qualify because we aren’t specifically following anyone.

HOW TO DO A TRACKING SHOT

There are many factors to consider when filming a tracking shot. These include the lens, depth of field, speed of movement, direction, what sort of stabilizer to use, framing and camera angle, blocking and staging, and editing. 

Wide lenses tend to amplify the speed of a tracking shot, while a telephoto lens can compress the foreground, middle ground, and background to create layers of movement. A shallow depth of field can isolate your subject.

Speed is also a consideration — if you want to generate suspense (go slow), if you want to add energy (go fast). This also determines which direction you want the camera to track the character. Following them from behind might suggest tension or mystery while leading them from the front can create a more powerful or confident perspective.

There are many types of stabilization that each have an effect on the tracking shot. For example, a smooth dolly shot or Steadicam tracking shot vs. a frenetic handheld camera. Drones have recently begun expanding the scope and range of the tracking shot.

Do you want a more neutral tracking shot, try framing the subject in a medium shot. For a more intense or claustrophobic tracking shot effect, tighten the frame into a close-up. Finally, the question becomes, how long do you sustain the tracking shot? Should the shot last for over two minutes, or should you cut between multiple tracking shots instead?

There’s a reason the tracking shot in film is so popular — it can accomplish so many moods and energies. And once you understand how versatile the tracking shot is, you’ll be hooked.

CHARACTERIZATION EXPLAINED

When authors and screenwriters create characters, they do so through a process called characterization. This generally involves providing information to the reader or viewer that builds these characters one layer at a time. By the end of the story, ideally, you would have a fully-formed character inside and out. When done right, the audience receives all this information without realizing it. In this video, we will uncover the two main characterization methods and their importance in creating dimensional, interesting, and engaging characters.

WHAT IS CHARACTERIZATION

Characterization is how writers present and describe their characters. Think about this — the task is to make the audience believe that the character is “real,” at least enough to empathize and engage with them. The audience must understand who these characters are based on how they look, what they say, how they act, where they live, what they wear, etc. A writer could just list off all of this information, but it’s usually more powerful for the audience to do their own assessment. Let’s look at the two main types of characterization.

DIRECT CHARACTERIZATION

In literature, direct characterization is how the author describes the character. In film, unless there is a narrator providing the same information, direct characterization is what we can observe about a character. For example, their appearance. A lot can be communicated immediately through the wardrobe, physicality, and hair/make-up. We can also intuit much about them from their settings, like their homes, car, or how they blend in (or not) with their environment. This is the more objective characterization technique.

INDIRECT CHARACTERIZATION

The other main type is indirect characterization, which is what we can discern about a character through their behavior, actions, and dialogue. As you’ve heard, actions speak louder than words, and it is up to the audience to decipher these actions to complete the characterization. As Robert McKee notes, “The revelation of true character in contrast or contradiction to characterization is fundamental to all fine storytelling.”
Indirect and direct characterization can yield a character we believe in and root for.

ANATOMY OF A GREAT SCENE

What makes a great movie scene? While no two scenes are the same, there are consistent elements of a great scene. In this video, we’re going to take a scalpel to some of the best scenes in film history to understand the anatomy of a great scene. These include conflict, character development, plot function, and blocking & staging. A great scene doesn’t need all four of these elements — the recipe for each scene is unique and variant. Let’s look at them individually.

Without conflict, there would be no storytelling. Through the course of a single story, the protagonist must encounter conflict and obstacles in the way of their goal. At a scene level, the conflict can be minimal as long as their is sufficient conflict overall. And there are different types that can be employed like physical, verbal, internal, or environmental conflict.

A great scene should also be designed to serve the character along their arc. An individual scene can function as a tiny nudge in that direction or a full-on shove — but without some effect on the character, you might have to question if you need the scene at all.

The same criteria applies to how the scene functions on a plot level. Does the scene move the plot forward (and in the right direction) or does it slow the pacing and feel out of place? It’s one thing to write a great scene on its own but if it doesn’t add to the storytelling, it’s best to cut it.

Finally, it is the director’s responsibility to turn these written elements into a functional scene with blocking and staging. Is the camera static or would the scene benefit from a slow push in? Is there a way to use the character’s movements in the scene to enhance the conflict or character development? 

The combination and execution of these elements is completely flexible and subjective. But when the elements of a great scene come together, there’s nothing better.

THE HISTORY OF ANIMATION & EVOLUTION OF ANIMATION STYLES

From the beginning of film history, filmmakers have experimented with animation in many forms and techniques. In this video, we will lay out a brief history of animation and the evolution of animation styles. Including the techniques, the technologies, the differences, and the various mediums animators use to give their inanimate subjects the illusion of life.

The word animation comes from Latin  ""animatio"" and means “a bestowing of life.” Like film, animation is the illusion of movement through the rapid succession of images created by a process called “persistence of vision.” This works because when we see one image, it is retained on our retina for a fraction of a second, just long enough for a second image to appear — and thus, we see a single moving image instead of a series of flashing static images.

Traditional animation was the dominant type of animation in the 20th century. Basically, this involves drawing images, frame-by-frame. As the years went on, new techniques were developed to turn animation into more of an assembly line process. Animators like Walt Disney and his studio helped turn animation into a viable commercial and artistic medium.

Rotoscoping is a technique that uses live-action footage as a reference to create animation with more realistic movement. Today, we can see variations of this process in films like Richard Linklater’s Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly. Anime is an umbrella term used to describe Japanese animation, which tends to share many of the same styles and techniques as Western animation, along with some key deviations. 

Stop-motion animation is also similar to traditional animation, except the subjects are often physical objects instead of drawings, like puppets or figurines. Claymation is a sub-type of stop-motion animation that uses plasticine clay. Cut-out animation uses shapes or characters cut out of paper or fabric and moved frame-by-frame. More recently, 3D animation has replaced 2D animation as the most common animation style. And, yet, it follows the same general principles.

WHAT IS JUXTAPOSITION IN FILM

Juxtaposition is such a common technique in art, it’s easy to miss it. But the artists who have mastered the art of juxtaposition understand how to communicate their ideas on a more sophisticated level. In this video, we’re going to break down the many ways a filmmaker can use juxtaposition in film, including the imagery, the sounds, and the editing. 

WHAT IS JUXTAPOSITION

Juxtaposition is the process of placing two or more things together in order to invoke their similarities and/or differences. This helps define the relationship between things, but it also conjures up more intellectual or philosophical ideas about them. One of the most iconic examples of juxtaposition in literature is the opening to Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…” and it goes on from there. By pairing up these disparate ideas, Dickens paints a layered and complicated picture.

JUXTAPOSITION IN FILM — MISE-EN-SCENE

There are many ways to use juxtaposition in film. We can start with the broad category of mise-en-scene, which includes elements such as color, costume, props, set design, lighting, and even composition. These are visual elements that can be combined to create ideas and meaning greater than the sum of their parts.

JUXTAPOSITION IN FILM — SOUND & MUSIC

On the soundtrack, there are even more options. For example, the opening title sequence for The Shining has peaceful and idyllic landscapes paired with music that inspires dread. The juxtaposition of sound and image, then, creates an unsettling mood. Dialogue can also be paired with imagery that seem to contradict each other. In the opening for Trainspotting, Renton’s voiceover implores the viewer to choose life and many other comforts of the civilized world — all while he evades the police chasing him after a robbery.

JUXTAPOSITION IN FILM — EDITING

Editing is another fantastic way to create juxtaposition in film. As we know from the Kuleshov Effect, cutting from one thing to another creates a relationship between them. So, in Rocky IV, when we see how Rocky trains versus how Drago trains, we understand their dynamics, we establish the odds against our protagonist, and we build each fighter’s characterization at the same time.

CINEMATOGRAPHY OF THE LAST OF US

Fans and critics alike have praised the adaptation of The Last of Us as one of the greatest video game-to-TV transfers. It would be easy enough to just replicate the shots from the game, but perhaps it goes beyond that. Maybe it is that the “experience” of watching the show so closely resembles the experience of playing the game. This was certainly the goal of the showrunners and cinematographers, and it informed many of their visual decisions, including the lighting, camera movement, and lens choices. In this video, we will dive into these choices that made the cinematography of The Last of Us so compelling.

THE LAST OF US CINEMATOGRAPHY — CAMERAS AND LENSES

One of the goals was to keep the environments visible around the characters. As DP Ksenia Sereda says, “We needed to be able to stay close but at the same time preserve the depth of background.” This helps keep the audience engaged in the world itself, not just with the characters. Plus, this extra negative space is a subtle reminder that an infected to could pop out at any moment. For more tense, claustrophobic scenes, like in the climactic scene of episode five, longer lenses collapse the depth for maximum tension.

THE LAST OF US CINEMATOGRAPHY — LIGHTING

DP Eben Bolter describes the lighting scheme as “cinematic naturalism,” which means grounding the visuals in the scene's reality. “It was about lighting a room rather than a shot. And letting flaws exist, and leaning into those flaws.” In other words, for the audience to immerse themselves as active participants, the world needed to look as real as possible.
Bolter also describes using a technique called “skip lighting,” which has exterior light bouncing off props or set dressing inside. Since electricity wasn’t always available in the story world, this simple technique maintains that reality.

THE LAST OF US CINEMATOGRAPHY — CAMERAWORK

As another element meant to ground the viewer in the reality of this post-apocalypse, handheld camerawork was heavily employed. According to Bolter, about 80 to 90 of each episode used this strategy. But instead of a literal handheld camera, they used a ZeeGee mount which provides the stability of a Steadicam but the look and feel of a handheld camera.
The difference in engagement between playing a video game and watching a TV show is worlds apart. But as the team behind the cinematography of The Last of Us has shown, it’s perhaps not as impossible as previously thought.

VIRTUAL PRODUCTION EXPLAINED

If you’ve been paying attention to current filmmaking technology and techniques, you’ve likely heard of virtual production. On shows like The Mandalorian and films like The Batman, virtual production seems to be the next big thing in how projects are shot. But how does virtual production work, and is it really the wave of the future or just another Hollywood tech fad? In this video, we will dive into these topics as we explore the pros and cons of virtual production in film and TV.

WHAT IS VIRTUAL PRODUCTION

In short, virtual production is a broad term in which live-action and virtual elements are captured simultaneously. To explain how virtual production works, we need a quick lesson in film history. For decades, filmmakers have “cheated” backgrounds with techniques like rear and front projection. Then green and blue screen technology became the dominant way to composite real foregrounds with fake backgrounds in a process called “keying.” 

But all of those technologies have drawbacks. Virtual production is something of a hybrid between the projection and keying systems of the past, with improvements in both. Let’s discuss how virtual production works.

HOW VIRTUAL PRODUCTION WORKS

The most common virtual production setup these days is a set surrounded and covered by LED walls. On these screens, any background can be shown. Usually, these are CG backgrounds created by software like Unreal Engine, mostly known for creating video game environments. One thing missing from the original rear- and front-projection systems was something called parallax — when background elements move according to the camera's movement. But in a virtual production setup, the camera has trackers that connect its position to the background software, effectively eliminating this parallax problem.

THE PROS AND CONS OF VIRTUAL PRODUCTION

Virtual production benefits film and TV productions in a few ways. The lighting emitted from the LED walls matches the scenes exactly. The production can switch “locations” easily. The actors have an environment around them instead of a blank green void. Atmospherics like rain or smoke can be captured live on set. And as mentioned, it solves the parallax issue.

But there are drawbacks to virtual production as well. To shoot on a soundstage with a full virtual production setup like The Mandalorian is highly expensive. Low-budget alternatives are emerging, however. Even though realistic parallax is possible, the camera movement is still limited to the confines of the set. At the moment, direct hard sunlight is hard to capture realistically, which limits most exterior settings to darker or overcast conditions.

So, that is a quick introduction to how virtual production works. It solves a lot of problems in film and TV production, but it doesn’t solve them all.

WRITING SUBTEXT IN SCREENPLAYS

In storytelling, as in life, what we say and do is only a fraction of what we really mean. That unspoken or secondary meaning is called subtext, and it is a skill many writers seek to master. In this video, we will cover the mechanics of how to write good subtext in a screenplay, including subtext examples in dialogue, action/description, and the actors’ performances.

WHAT IS SUBTEXT

This idea of “subtext” can be traced back to a legend in the theatre world — Konstantin Stanislavski. As a lesson for actors, he had this to say about subtext: “Keep in mind that a person says only ten percent of what lies in their head, ninety percent remains unspoken.” It’s an insightful truth — think about how much of what’s in your head actually gets expressed. And for writers to capture “truth” in dialogue, character action, and behavior, logic suggests that their screenplays should leave most things “unsaid.”

Another way to understand and define subtext is to explain the relationship between text and context. Text is the surface-level meaning of our words and actions. It is the words we actually say or the actions we take. Context is the circumstances around the text — the culmination of information and events that have led up to the text. Subtext, then, is created by combining the text and context. For example, let’s say the text is someone blowing out birthday candles. But in Scene 1, the context has the character surrounded by friends and family, while Scene 2 has them completely alone. The same text, two different contexts, and two very different subtexts.

HOW TO WRITE SUBTEXT

Subtext in dialogue is perhaps the most obvious way to reveal what’s beneath the surface. When Don Corleone says, “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse,” what he really means (the subtext) is, “If he doesn’t do what I’m asking him to do, I will kill him.” Leaving that direct meaning unsaid is far more powerful and menacing.

Beyond dialogue, subtext can also be written into a character’s action. In Pulp Fiction, Jules takes a massive bite out of Brett’s hamburger. Without saying it, this simple act creates a clear message: Jules has all the power.

Finally, the actor’s performance is a more nuanced but huge opportunity for subtext. With clues the writer provides in the script, the actor can use body language to suggest what lies beneath the surface. In Moonlight, Black stares at the door, debating whether to escape another possible heartbreak. 

Writing subtext in screenplays is not easy. The temptation writers face is to put everything onto the page as text but, going back to Stanislavski, it’s better to leave things unsaid.

WHAT IS A METAPHOR

Metaphors are deceptively simple. We use them all the time in our everyday conversations. And yet there is a strict definition for “What is a metaphor” that most people aren’t aware of. For the average person, there is no pressing need to understand the art of metaphor, but the same cannot be said for writers. In this video, we’re going to define metaphor, the eight different types, how they work, and how writers can add them to their literary arsenal.

METAPHOR DEFINITION

Let’s start with a metaphor definition. A metaphor is a figure of speech that compares an object to another object with similar characteristics. It uses conjugations of “to be” like “I am,” “She is,” or “They are.” For example, “love is a battlefield.” Four elements are necessary to create a metaphor: the tenor, the vehicle, the ground, and the tension. The tenor is the subject in question (love), and the vehicle is the object of comparison (battlefield). The ground is what these two things have in common (both can be treacherous endeavors), and the tension makes them distinct (love is an emotion, while battlefields are sites of physical conflict).

“Love is a battlefield” is the standard, pure type of metaphor, but there are many others to explain.

TYPES OF METAPHORS

SIMILE VS METAPHOR
A simile is a type of metaphor that uses qualifiers such as “like” or “as” to make comparisons. For example, when Shrek proclaims that “Ogres are like onions.” 

IMPLIED METAPHOR
An implied metaphor makes a comparison, but it’s more implicit. For example, in Whiplash, a character says, “Don’t worry about Fletcher. He’s more bark than bite.” Fletcher is being compared to a dog without saying exactly that.

EXTENDED METAPHOR
An extended metaphor is a comparison expressed over many lines. Perhaps the most famous example would be, “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women are merely players…” from Shakespeare’s As You Like It.

DEAD METAPHOR
A dead metaphor is a metaphor that has been overused and turned into a cliche. Examples of these would include “You’re breaking my heart” and “Time is running out.”

CONTROLLING METAPHOR
A controlling metaphor is used throughout the story, often to speak the overall theme. In Turning Red, Mei turning into a giant red panda is a metaphor for the pains of puberty.

MIXED METAPHOR
A mixed metaphor combines two comparisons incorrectly. For example, “The early bird gathers no moss.”

VISUAL METAPHOR
Finally, a visual metaphor is simply a comparison made visually. This can be done in a single image (like fireworks exploding during a romantic moment) or between images, like Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein intercut strikers being killed with cattle being slaughtered. 

As you can see, the art of metaphor has wide-ranging implications. A writer or filmmaker can inject extra layers of meaning into their dialogue and imagery, adding sophistication and nuance to their work.

THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO CINEMATIC LIGHTING TECHNIQUES — PART TWO

Cinematic lighting is something most filmmakers are after but what is cinematic lighting anyway? Many people agree that the difference between amateur and professional film is decided by the quality of a project’s lighting. In the first episode of this cinematic lighting guide, we covered the basics of lighting, and the general styles and approaches. Now we’re going to discuss how to get cinematic lighting by shooting subjects, backgrounds, daytime vs. nighttime, and interiors vs. exteriors.

CINEMATIC LIGHTING SETUP FOR SUBJECTS

First, we’ll look at how to light your subjects. Using the most common portrait lighting setups like butterfly lighting, loop lighting, split lighting, and more. Each of these lighting techniques literally casts a different light on your subject, which in turn can alter their characterization and how we relate to them. We’ll also get into how to light multiple subjects in a scene.

HOW TO LIGHT A SCENE — EXTERIOR DAY/NIGHT

There are countless lighting scenarios but they can all be boiled down to basically four — exterior day, exterior night, interior day, and interior night. Shooting outside during the day is difficult mostly because your main light source (the sun) is constantly changing. In our video, we learn from DPs like Robert Richardson shooting Casino and Emmanuel Lubezki shooting The Revenant. 

Shooting outside at night presents its own challenges, but with today’s cameras, low-light cinematography is not nearly the challenge it used to be. For example, we learn how DP Jeff Cutter simulated moonlight on Prey or how Jarin Blaschke embraced the shadows on The Witch.

HOW TO LIGHT A SCENE — INTERIOR DAY/NIGHT

Lighting an interior during the day can be a lot easier than shooting outside but you’re still dealing with the sun. DP Roger Deakins blacked out windows and used exterior lighting for the opening scene in Sicario. DP Matthew Libatique had more control with the stage set in The Whale. You can also go more stylized with the nighttime lighting, like Kubrick and his DP Larry Smith did on Eyes Wide Shut.

Cinematic lighting techniques like this are used all the time. And with lessons from masterful DPs, we can all approach any lighting situation with confidence.

CANDLELIGHT CINEMATOGRAPHY

Working with candlelight is a rite of passage for any cinematographer. As you can imagine, doing so is quite difficult, and there are a few considerations involved. In this video, we’re going to learn how to light a scene with candlelight from a DP who has plenty of experience — Claudio Miranda. Topics include the types of lenses to use, ISO and sensor settings, specialty candles, and more.

HOW TO LIGHT A SCENE WITH CANDLELIGHT

In 1975, Stanley Kubrick and DP John Alcott famously shot Barry Lyndon’s candlelight cinematography. But to do so, they needed multiple candles and a lens specifically designed by NASA. Today, it’s a lot easier, but that doesn’t mean it is easy.

As Miranda explains, one of the first things to consider is the ISO and sensor settings on the camera. On Oblivion, one scene was to be lit with a single candle between two characters. The camera they used was the Sony F65 with an 800 ASA. But that was not enough — the background projection system used to light the set was lowered, and the shutter speed was adjusted to get “the last gulp of exposure.”

Lens choice is also a key consideration. When shooting candles in low light, Miranda recommends a lens that can open up to at least a 1.4 aperture. He also mentions how every lens has unique characteristics and that even though it might have desirable effects in a normally lit scene, it can underperform in low-light scenarios.

Beyond using a single candle, what happens when there are literally thousands? In a crowd scene from Life of Pi, Miranda explains that over 120,000 candles were used. In fact, all the extra lighting Miranda had brought to the set as a contingency plan was not needed. 

In other scenes, supplemental lighting is necessary. For example, in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, lighting with candlelight alone proved insufficient. An additional practical was added to boost the level. 

Cinematic lighting with candlelight is more possible today than it has ever been. With the right camera, lenses, and (potentially) additional lighting, working with candlelight can turn a simple scene into the most visually striking in the entire project. Thanks to DPs like Claudio Miranda sharing their knowledge, candlelight cinematography is within the grasp of any cinematographer.

TERMINATOR 2 BEHIND THE SCENES

The making of Terminator 2 is just as fascinating as the film itself. Co-writer/director James Cameron and his crew used every tool available to create the ultimate cinematic experience. In this video, we go behind the scenes of Terminator 2 to uncover the secrets of its creation. We’ll cover topics like how lighting and cinematography, practical effects, and cutting-edge CGI combined to realize Cameron’s greatest action spectacle.

THE MAKING OF TERMINATOR 2 — CINEMATOGRAPHY

Returning from the original, DP Adam Greenberg carried over many aesthetic choices but on an entirely new scale. This includes lighting the terminators in a cold blue light to enhance their brutality and top lighting on Arnold Schwarzenegger to accent his facial musculature. For the iconic highway chase, Greenberg took two weeks to pre-light a 5-mile stretch of freeway, borrowing every available power cord in Hollywood to connect all the lights.

TERMINATOR 2 SPECIAL EFFECTS

Throughout his career, James Cameron has been on the cutting edge of both practical and visual effects. The way he uses models, miniatures, rear projection, and just about every in-camera effect known to man is a testament to his filmmaking prowess. Examples include the animatronics of the T-800 or the nightmarish nuclear blast sequence. And then there are more simple yet effective decisions like hiring twins to play characters replicated by the T-1000. All of this is in service of the story and the experience.

TERMINATOR 2 VISUAL EFFECTS

Of course, not everything could be achieved in-camera. The Terminator 2 visual effects team pushed the craft beyond what anyone had seen before. In his previous film, The Abyss, Cameron tasked the team at ILM to create “the pseudopod” — a tentacle made of water. This was merely a test run for something Cameron had dreamed of since the first Terminator film: a liquid metal terminator. Now, the T-1000 could change shape, walk through bars, and assume the identity of anyone. No one had seen anything like this, which paved the way for future CGI work in films like Jurassic Park.

Filmmakers today might not fully understand why the making of Terminator 2 was such an achievement. But it’s our hope that by looking back on the work of craftsmen and craftswomen like James Cameron that we realize just how far we come and how much we owe to them.

STAR WARS BEHIND THE SCENES — THE MAKING OF A NEW HOPE

The making of Star Wars A New Hope is stuff of legend. Today, blockbuster movies are a dime-a-dozen and the magic of how they’re actually created has all but disappeared. But in 1977, George Lucas and his team at ILM were still magicians, crafting never-before-seen imagery that changed the industry forever. In this short making of Star Wars documentary, we’ll explain how they evolved practical effects, compositing techniques, and sound design.

STAR WARS MOVIES SPECIAL EFFECTS

Compared to the scope and vision of George Lucas’ galaxy far, far away, Star Wars was a low-budget production. One of the ways they were able to pull this off was to use practical effects. This ranged from making Luke’s landspeeder to be a functional vehicle but appeared to float above the ground, to the extensive use of matte paintings that could extend the sets and add extras.

STAR WARS VISUAL EFFECTS

What the crew couldn’t accomplish on set, the visual effects team handled. For example, some of the most dazzling sequences in the film are the space battles. But up until that time, the compositing techniques for photographing a ship in space was very limited. To capture the WWII dogfight footage Lucas shared as inspiration, the ships needed to have more dynamic mobility. The solution was something called the Dykstraflex, a motion-control camera that could be programmed precisely to execute the same movements multiple times. This allowed them to capture as many elements as they needed while giving the ships the desired movement and energy in the frame.

STAR WARS SFX

The final element in creating a fantastical yet believable world was the sound design. To be fair, the concept of a sound designer didn’t even exist yet. Ben Burtt, responsible for the sound effects coined the term for himself, essentially creating a new filmmaking role in the process. Here, too, revolutionary changes were being made to create the most iconic sounds like R2-D2’s bleeps and bloops, Darth Vader’s ominous breathing, and, of course, the hum of the lightsabers. To do this, Burtt mixed the sounds of a humming projector with a TV set — the swinging sabers were created by playing this sound through a speaker and waving a microphone in front of it.

Without all these innovations, there’s a good chance Star Wars would’ve simply gone unnoticed. Instead, it raised the bar for filmmaking in Hollywood with low-budget techniques to create an unforgettable cultural experience.

DARIUS KHONDJI CINEMATOGRAPHY

You may not know his name but you’ve certainly seen his work. Cinematographer Darius Khondji has been behind some of the best films of the last few decades. Working with celebrated auteurs like David Fincher, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Bong Joon-ho, the Safdie Brothers, James Gray, and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Khondji’s style blends with each director’s aesthetic. And, yet, there are some clear throughlines we can see. In this episode of Cinematography Techniques, we’ll break each of those down, including his approach to exposure, overhead lighting, and the colors green and gold.

One of Khondji’s stylistic strengths is how he approaches exposure. In Se7en, extreme underexposure creates dark and sinister interiors. Added to this was a bleach bypass treatment of the negative that increases contrast and desaturates color. The overall look is bleak, which fits perfectly with the subject matter and the themes at play.

Another one of Khondji’s preferences is overhead lighting. Depending on the context, this type of lighting has various effects. In Okja, for example, Mija and her eponymous friend walk passed massive pens with other super pigs preparing for slaughter. The overhead lights cast hard downward shadows on her face as the blue moonlight adds a layer of melancholy. 

Finally, no matter the director or project, Darius Khondji clearly has a thing for green and gold. Sometimes in isolation, sometimes in combination, they add a distinct look and feel from the usual blue and orange. In a film like The City of Lost Children, the highly saturated greens mix with almost nostalgic golds. These competing colors match the competing forces at work — the innocence and warmth of children against the nightmarish plot of a scientist out to steal it from them.

Darius Khondji cinematography is unlike any other. And in the process of aiding these auteurs to manifest their visions, Khondji has created a visual style that is rich, edgy, and inspiring.

WHAT IS AN ANTAGONIST IN STORYTELLING

Every story needs a protagonist, a main character pursuing a goal. And every protagonist needs obstacles in their way — cue the antagonist. In this video, we will examine what constitutes an antagonist, its characteristics and function, and the various types of antagonists in storytelling.

WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF ANTAGONIST

According to John Yorke, an antagonist is “the sum total of all the obstacles that obstruct a character in the pursuit of their desires. They are the problem or obstacle the protagonist has to overcome.” Unlike the protagonist, who is usually a character, an antagonist can be many things.

TYPES OF ANTAGONISTS

The most common antagonist is the villain, an evil character prone to doing evil things. In many cases, it is up to the protagonist to stop them. But remember, an antagonist can be anything that keeps the protagonist from reaching their goals. This could be the environment around them, especially in disaster films. Animals, the big and dangerous ones, in particular, make great antagonists. 

An anti-villain is an antagonist whose motives clash with the protagonist, even if they want the same thing. Sometimes, an antagonist turns out to be an ally all along — this is a false antagonist. A character who is only revealed as the antagonist in the end is called the hidden antagonist. Inanimate objects like robots or ghosts are also prime antagonists. And, finally, one of the most interesting antagonists is the protagonist themselves, or rather something in their character that prevents them from succeeding.

MULTIPLE ANTAGONISTS

Beyond these variations and types of antagonists, some stories benefit from having more than one. Group antagonists are commonly found in genres such as war films (army vs army) or sports films (team vs team). There is also the opportunity to combine different types in the same film. In Titanic, Jack and Rose must battle against her fiance Cal before the iceberg creates a new antagonist: the sinking ship. 

It’s a natural tendency for writers to focus more on their protagonists, but an equal amount of attention should be paid to their antagonists as well. As Robert McKee said, “A protagonist and their story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism make them.”

THE DOLLY ZOOM EFFECT EXPLAINED

You know that moment in Jaws when Chief Brody sees the shark attack happening — the background stretches behind him as if reality itself is breaking apart. This intense and mind-bending shot is called a dolly zoom and it has been used for decades to capture moments like this. But how does the dolly zoom effect work and how many ways can it be used? In the video, we’ll explain the mechanics of the shot, the applications for it, and how to enhance it with lighting, camera angle, and sound design.

WHAT IS THE DOLLY ZOOM EFFECT

As Alfred Hitchcock explains, the idea for the dolly zoom goes back to one night when he was drunk. He described the sensation as “everything going far away from me” and an idea was born to recreate that experience in a film. The goal was to keep the subject fixed in the frame while the background stretched behind them. Hitchcock first wanted to use the shot in Rebecca when Joan Fontaine’s character faints but he couldn’t figure out how to do it. Nearly two decades later, when Hitchcock was making his classic Vertigo. It was a cameraman on the film named Irmin Roberts who found the solution — to zoom out while the dolly pushed in. 

WHEN TO USE THE DOLLY ZOOM EFFECT

The dolly zoom effect can really amp up a moment like in Jaws, or it can work more subtly in the background to slowly crank up the tension. It is perfect for any sort of sudden or dramatic emotional or tonal shift — for positive and negative emotions alike. The dolly zoom effect is great for moments of fear, disorientation, infatuation, panic, revelation, etc. It can be the ideal way to accent and emphasize any important character moment.

HOW TO ENHANCE THE VERTIGO EFFECT

The textbook dolly zoom maneuver is visually compelling on its own but there are also a number of ways to enhance the Vertigo effect. For example, changing the lighting during the shot — like in The Lion King when Simba panics before the oncoming stampede. Sound design is also often paired with the camera movement as additional sensory input. For example, in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, when Peter is told how his mother really died, the soundtrack introduces a descending bass note, while high strings rise in the mix. The two complementary sounds nicely parallel the complementary movements of the lens and the camera.

The dolly zoom effect is relatively simple and it certainly looks cool. But the filmmakers that have been most successful using the Vertigo effect only when necessary to enhance a particular moment in a way that is beyond our normal visual experience.

HOW TO WRITE THE MIDPOINT OF A STORY

The T-Rex attack in Jurassic Park, the shower scene in Psycho, and Michael’s restaurant hit in The Godfather — some of the most iconic scenes in film history, right? They also function as one of a story’s most important plot points: the midpoint. In this video, we’ll explain why the midpoint is so important and the various types writers can choose from that best fits their story.

WHAT IS A MIDPOINT

The concept of the midpoint was popularized by screenwriting guru Syd Field after he noticed his students were struggling in the second act of a three-act structure. It was his friend, director Sam Peckinpah, who explained that he always liked to hang his films on a “centerpiece,” usually in the middle, to keep the momentum going and/or to change the story’s direction. And, so, Field took this and dubbed it “the midpoint” — a major story beat or turning point in the middle of Act Two that connects the beginning and end while giving the story a boost of energy into the climax and final act.

TYPES OF MIDPOINTS

Even though the midpoint placement is fairly consistent (middle of Act Two), various types of midpoints will change the story in various ways. Choosing which type to use depends on the story and how you want the new trajectory to unfold into Act Three. The first type of midpoint is the setback. This is when the protagonist encounters a major obstacle that places them further away from their goal. Like in Dune, when House Atreides is betrayed, Duke Leto is killed, and Paul and Lady Jessica are exiled to the desert.

This is similar to another type of midpoint called a false defeat. This involves a temporary defeat or setback that becomes an opportunity to find a new, better plan. We can see this in The Matrix when the Oracle confirms Neo’s suspicions that he is not The One. Of course, Neo eventually does prove to be The One after he believes it for himself.

On the opposite side, there’s also a false victory midpoint — the hero believes they have made a breakthrough toward their goal only to realize it would ultimately lead to failure. In 500 Days of Summer, Tom believes that he is developed a deep romantic connection with Summer, which makes their breakup all the more devastating.

A reversal shifts the entire story and the protagonist’s goals. Like when Joel wants to reverse the procedure that is erasing Clementine from his memory in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There’s also the twist midpoint which is a major turning point the audience had no idea was coming that changes the direction, protagonist, or even the genre.

The midpoint in a story holds a lot of potential for writers to push their narrative in unexpected and compelling ways. If you can crack the midpoint, you can crack the entire story.

SUPERHERO MOVIE TROPES

Every genre has tropes and cliches they must embrace, and superhero movies no exception. But that doesn’t mean they can’t also be thoughtfully and interestingly done. In this video, we’re going to break down two of the most common tropes we find in superhero movies and how filmmakers can avoid the pitfalls associated with them.

THE TROPE — UNLIMITED STRENGTH

By definition, a superhero has abilities beyond us mere mortals. But at what point does the “all-powerful” hero become “too powerful?” Sometimes, this is due to their powers being poorly defined, so the audience is never quite sure what they can and can’t do. For example, we know Captain America is strong, but when we see him prevent a helicopter from taking off with his bare hands, it seems like a stretch. When these heroes are able to exert such power, the direct effect is an inability to suspend our disbelief (which is a requirement of fantastic movies like these).

The antidote for this trope is to show the effort it takes to pull off such feats of strength. For example, in Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker stops a runaway train. On paper, it might seem like this would be beyond his abilities, but director Sam Raimi and writer Alvin Sargent make sure we believe it. For one, they have Peter’s first plan fail — his second plan finally succeeds after a second attempt at it. There’s also the duration of the operation — it takes Peter nearly 2 minutes to stop the train. Finally, numerous close-ups of Tobey Maguire’s performance showcase the extreme strain he is experiencing.

THE TROPE — DAMAGE TOLERANCE INFINITY

Along with super strength, another one of the most common superhero movie tropes is when the heroes can’t get hurt. Granted, some heroes have healing powers while others are just super tough, but this, too, should have limits applied. If the hero can survive a nuclear bomb or have the power of a dying star blasting through them, there’s no real danger to our protagonist. 

One way to combat superhero cliches like this is to create emotional pain. The hero may be impervious to physical damage, but their heart isn’t. For example, all of Dr. Manhattan’s god-like power makes him an isolated and profoundly lonely character. Another tactic is to transfer that damage to those the character cares about. Superman is bulletproof, but when he can’t save his father from a tornado, the pain pierces right through him.

We all like superheroes and their spectacular abilities. They are the perfect subjects to deliver the big, loud, and amazing images we crave from the theatrical experience. But filmmakers should remember that keeping our suspension of disbelief is just as important.

WHAT IS THE THEME OF A STORY

Theme in storytelling in an inextricable element that all writers deal with. It’s also a difficult concept to grasp, let alone work with. Our goal in this video on theme is to break down this complex and allusive element to make it as simple, digestible and applicable as possible. Along the way, we’ll dive into five different elements in writing where the theme of a story can be constructed.

WHAT’S A THEME?

Theme is the central and unifying idea or principle in a story. In the simplest terms, “plot” is what happens in a story and “theme” is what that story is actually about at its core. For example, the plot for Jurassic Park focuses on people surviving on an island with dinosaurs. But the theme is focused on what happens when humans try to play god. 

HOW TO WRITE THEME IN A SCREENPLAY

There are five main ways writers can work with theme: characters, dialogue, setting, motifs, and symbols. Once you’ve identified the theme, one of the first things you might want to do is find the characters that would best represent it. For example, a major theme in The Dark Knight is order vs. chaos, and each of the main characters represents one side or the other. Harvey Dent, Gordon, the Mayor represent justice and order. On the other side of the coin, the Joker and the rest of the Gotham underworld are representatives of chaos. Much of the dialogue then is ideally suited to discuss this theme and its balance for the citizens of Gotham.

Setting is also a more visual way to express theme in storytelling. First, there is the general time and place of the story. In Parasite, the major themes revolve around the divide between rich and poor, and the illusion of upward mobility. One way the setting expresses these themes is through the set design of both the Park and Kim family homes. One is a near-subterranean hovel, while the other is an elevated and expansive home, making the difference between “upper” and “lower” classes a literal representation.

Finally, there are motifs and symbols. A motif is anything we can assign meaning to because of its repetition. A symbol is anything meant to represent something else. In Everything Everywhere All at Once, the theme is the dichotomy between kindness and empathy vs. nihilism and despair, both of which have their own symbol. The googly eyes and the everything bagel, to be exact, and their designs become an interesting “yin and yang” to represent the balance between them that Evelyn is striving for.

What is the theme of a story? That might be the hardest question for any writer to answer. But once you do, there are many ways to weave that idea into your work.

RRR ANALYSIS — HOW SS RAJAMOULI DIRECTS ACTION

If you have seen RRR, you know that director SS Rajamouli crafted some of the most spectacular action of recent memory. And yet, no matter how big and epic the action, each of these sequences is grounded in emotion. As Rajamouli himself explains, “The way I operate is on the basis of emotion…I cannot function otherwise.” So, in this video, let’s break down the action scenes in RRR to see what “emotional spectacle” looks like.

One thing SS Rajamouli does in RRR is to plant some of the film’s major story beats inside an action sequence. For example, our introductions to both lead characters are delivered through epic action. Their first meeting is a daring rescue attempt and their falling out is at the center of a chaotic siege. The result is an action scene with real dramatic weight, and the drama is accented by epic action.

Another tactic to create the highest emotional content is to structure the action scene as a self-contained story arc. We can see this in Raju’s introduction — his mission to apprehend a single rioter while battling the rest. By joining Raju on this mission, we share the catharsis of his victory, which leads to a more sympathetic and instant connection.

We can also look at how SS Rajamouli directs action to ensure that the emotional qualities reach the audience. One way this is done is to prioritize visual clarity. Instead of intense camera movement paired with frenetic editing, Rajamouli’s presentations are measured and clear. A technique we see in RRR is speed ramping, which slows down the action, keeps the pacing manageable, and allows for the action beats to register. 

This same effect is also with a nice balance of wide shots. Pulling away from the action might be counterintuitive, but wide shots have a distinct benefit — to maintain scene geography. The easiest way to confuse an audience is when they question, “where is everyone in relation to each other”? The emotional foundation will be lost if they can’t follow the action.

RRR is a rather bold piece of action spectacle. But the way SS Rajamouli directs the action, we never lose the emotional connection that runs through the entire film. As Rajamouli proves, action for action’s sake is a missed opportunity for filmmakers to balance spectacle with emotion and create a satisfying and entertaining cinematic experience.

SPIKE LEE DIRECTOR’S CHAIR

Spike Lee is one of the preeminent auteurs in American cinema. He built a reputation on a foundation of fierce independence and an unmistakable artistic voice. In this video, we collected Spike Lee interviews from throughout his career. From his film school days, including winning a student Academy Award, to winning another Oscar for writing BlacKkKlansman 3 decades later. 

WHO IS SPIKE LEE

Spike Lee was born on March 20, 1957 in Atlanta but spent his formative years in Brooklyn. In fact, there are few filmmakers as closely identified with their hometown as Lee is with that NY borough. After attending film school at NYU, he began his career with confrontational and poignant films while helping to usher in the independent film movement of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s.

SPIKE LEE JOINTS

In 1989, Spike Lee wrote and directed a landmark film called Do the Right Thing. It deals with racial tensions that boil to the surface and eventually erupt on the hottest day of the summer. The film is the exemplar for Lee’s ability to challenge his audiences with uncomfortable topics and no easy answers. As he explains, “For drama, you gotta have two people butt heads. And it elevates the drama when they’re both right.”

For his epic ode to Malcolm X, the studio wanted Lee to cut it down from 3 hours to 2. But Spike refused and explained that to truly honor the evolution of Malcolm’s life, the story needs to unfold organically. And when the budget ran low, Lee had to cold-call everyone he knew to help get the film finished. It is obstacles like these that have molded Lee’s work ethic: you gotta fight for your film.

Spike Lee doesn’t get the recognition he deserves. For over 4 decades, he has worked in various genres and mediums, like documentaries and commercials, and carved out a singular voice. If you’re a filmmaker looking for a guiding light through the insane world of filmmaking, Spike Lee is the one you need.

WHAT IS A PROTAGONIST IN A STORY

Most people understand that the protagonist is the main character in a story. But what is a protagonist, really? Are there special qualities they possess? And what happens if there are multiple protagonists? In this video, we’ll answer these questions, get into a little history of where the protagonist came from, their various types, and how writers can approach how to write a great protagonist.

HOW DO WE DEFINE PROTAGONIST

The protagonist is the lead character in a narrative. Typically, they have a goal they pursue, they make choices to advance the plot, and they will have some sort of character arc. If we go back to Ancient Greek theatre, we can see how the protagonist emerged. At the time, poems and tragedies were performed for an audience by a masked chorus (often 50 people) singing or speaking in unison. But then a poet named Thespis broke with tradition by having one actor, separate from the chorus, perform all of the parts of the story by simply switching masks. This is where we get the term “protagonist” which translates to “first actor.”

TYPES OF PROTAGONISTS

The most common and traditional type of protagonist is the hero. Originally, these were noble-born, pre-destined characters who were also strong, brave, and righteous. Over time, we see heroes with varying degrees of these characteristics. 

Beyond the traditional hero, there are anti-heroes, tragic heros, passive protagonists, and villain protagonists. Anti-heroes lack heroic qualities but they still pursue a righteous cause. Tragic heroes are just like traditional heroes except they have a fatal flaw in their character that leads to their downfall. Passive protagonists are still the main character but are forced into the story rather than making their own active choices. And villain protagonists are exactly that — villains who are the central figure in the story.

MULTIPLE PROTAGONISTS

But what about when there is more than one protagonist? Romantic films, both comedies and dramas, often feature two protagonists with equal weight in the story. There are also secondary and tertiary protagonists called deuteragonists and tritagonists, which are still main characters but fulfill more supporting roles. For example, in the Lord of the Rings, Frodo is the protagonist, Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are deuteragonists, and the rest of the fellowship are tritagonists. Finally, there are situations when two characters split the protagonist role among themselves. For example, in The Shawshank Redemption, it is Andy’s story and he is the one driving the plot forward, but we see all of this through Red’s eyes, and it is he who has the character arc.

Writers have many options when it comes to writing a strong protagonist. As we can see, there is a perfect option or combination of options for any story.

HOME ALONE AND DIE HARD ARE THE SAME MOVIE

Obviously, Home Alone is a Christmas movie and most reasonable people agree that Die Hard is a Christmas movie. But what if we told you that Home Alone is a remake of Die Hard? That’s right, our crack team of investigators have uncovered all the evidence that proves the John Hughes and Chris Columbus classic is a giant homage to McTiernan’s Die Hard. In this video, we’ll make the case that Home Alone and Die Hard are the same movie — and you won’t be able to watch them the same way again.

SIMILARITIES IN HOME ALONE AND DIE HARD — PLOT

Both scripts have a lone protagonist who must thwart robbers on Christmas Eve. They are separated from their families after a dispute. Indifferent police dispatchers are called but when patrolmen go to investigate, they find nothing out of sorts. Both John and Kevin must fend for themselves, improvising defense tactics and weapons. In the end, they are reunited with their families having recognized their faults and appreciated their loved ones.

SIMILARITIES IN HOME ALONE AND DIE HARD — CHARACTERS

John and Kevin both have Scottish/Irish ancestry (McClane, McAllister), they are prone to talking to themselves, and they have a signature catchphrase. In fact, Bonnie Bedelia who plays McClane’s wife Holly in Die Hard is actually Macaulay Culkin’s aunt in real life! Coincidence? At one point, they have a moment of reflection while looking at family photos in the hopes they’ll see them again. 
Sgt. Powell in Die Hard and Old Man Marley in Home Alone are also suspiciously similar characters. Both men begin as strangers to the hero but end up making a connection and actually save the day in the end. 

HOME ALONE EASTER EGGS

Beyond those more obvious connections between Home Alone and Die Hard, there are also a number of hidden easter eggs. For example, Uncle Frank’s argyle sweater is a clear nod to the character of Argyle the limo driver. As John drops his homemade bomb down the elevator, he says, “Geronimo!” And if you look closely in Buzz’s room, there’s a book about Geronimo. The logo for the Nakatomi Corporation looks like an inverted spider…just like the tarantula Kevin uses in his escape. And those are just the beginning.

After Die Hard was released, there were many copycats. But none were as disguised on the outside but blatant on the inside as Home Alone.

HOYTE VAN HOYTEMA CINEMATOGRAPHY STYLE EXPLAINED

When it comes to cinematography techniques, few DPs are given the budgets and the creative freedom to push the boundaries like Hoyte van Hoytema. It also helps that he works with top-shelf auteurs like Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Sam Mendes, and many others. But how does Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography style adapt to each director and each project? In this video, we’re going to illuminate some of the specific cinematography techniques Hoytema has employed in movies like Nope, Tenet, Spectre, Dunkirk, and Interstellar.

INNOVATIVE LIGHTING

One element of Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is his innovative use of lighting. When he shot Spectre, for example, he wanted to avoid the traditional three-point lighting. To do this, he skipped the fill light or even employed a negative fill to give these close-ups a darker edge than we’ve previously seen in a Bond film. For Interstellar, the tesseract sequence could have easily been shot in front of a giant green screen. But for a layer of verisimilitude (especially in such an abstract setting), Hoytema used rear projection that also gave the VFX team a realistic reference to the lighting.

MASTER OF IMAX

Another aspect of Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography style is his use of IMAX cameras. On Interstellar, he wanted the typically bulky and unwieldy cameras to be mobile. So, they developed handheld rigs and stripped away anything they didn’t absolutely need. This mobility allowed for a grounded realism and close-ups that were previously unheard of with IMAX cameras. On Dunkirk, Nolan set him another challenge to put IMAX cameras where they had never been before, like on the wing of a plane or inside a cockpit. Thanks to filmmakers like Nolan, Hoytema, and Peele, IMAX cinematography has now become not just an option but the standard for blockbuster films.

INTIMATE LENSES

Our last aspect of the Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography style is how he uses lenses for maximum intimacy. A fantastic example of these cinematography techniques can be found in Let the Right One In. With shallow focus, Hoytema creates an insular world around Oskar and keeps his focus on the budding relationship between him and Eli. 

Few would argue that Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is some of the best we’ve seen in the last few years. Even at the top end of budgets and studio filmmaking, Hoytema brings supreme skill to push boundaries while serving the story and creating a spectacle in the process.

THE MAKING OF AVATAR & AVATAR 2

Writer/director James Cameron has been dreaming of Avatar for decades. After years of brainstorming, the initial treatment was completed before he made Titanic. But motion capture technology was nowhere near able to manifest his vision. In this video, we’ll explain the making of Avatar, the evolution of motion capture technology, and how the making of Avatar 2 brought a whole new set of challenges.

AVATAR BEHIND THE SCENES

James Cameron’s goal for Avatar was to create a CG character with a full range of human emotions. Up to this point, animators would “copy” performances shot with motion capture, but for Cameron, this never quite hit the mark. His solution was to attach a small camera to the actor’s helmets to record their facial expressions at all times. Now the animators could tweak or augment these performances instead of having to create them themselves.

Another innovation made during the making of Avatar was the ability to use a “virtual camera” that could render the actor’s CG characters and the environment of Pandora in real-time. Now the blocking and compositions could be more refined and specific at the capture stage rather than have to compromise later in post-production.

Cameron was also able to use his 3D Fusion Camera System to shoot live-action footage. Unlike previous 3D cameras with fixed lenses, the Fusion camera could manipulate each camera to mimic human vision for a more natural and realistic 3D experience.

Finally, the SimulCam system also used the Fusion camera but could be “tracked” in the motion capture stage so that live-action footage could be shot alongside previously recorded CG elements. Thus reducing the number of compromises when compositing in post-production.

AVATAR 2 BEHIND THE SCENES

When filming Avatar 2, the biggest challenge was moving all of these systems underwater. The motion capture system required two additions — the first was a layer of white, plastic balls on the water’s surface to eliminate issues of reflections interfering with the infrared system. The second was that the actors couldn’t use scuba gear because the bubbles would also throw off the marker system. So, they just learned how to hold their breath while acting. Kate Winslet was able to do a breath hold for over seven minutes!

The making of Avatar and Avatar 2 will go down in history as defining moments when art and technology came together to produce something truly out of this world. And, of course, the man behind all this innovation (just like he is for every one of his movies) is the inimitable James Cameron.

WHAT ARE MOVIE GENRES

Most films belong to at least one (sometimes many) of the various movie genres. Whether you’re browsing a video store or Netflix, you can see all kinds of movies separated into categories. Drama, comedy, horror, romance, etc. But what are movie genres, really? Or perhaps a better question is how are film genres created in the first place? This video is an introduction to film genres, how they work, how they’re created, and why filmmakers should know film genres and their conventions.

WHERE DO MOVIE GENRES COME FROM

The term ‘genre’ comes from the French meaning “kind” or “sort.” But the concept of genre goes back to Ancient Greece where writers like Aristotle started with only two genres: poetry and drama. Since then, in theater, literature and eventually film, we’ve seen a multitude of categories. The type of movies we see today have been molded and refined over centuries, splintered off into smaller categories called subgenres. This process can be understood as a form of evolution, where less popular genres die out and those that remain relevant and interesting thrive to this day.

FILM GENRES AND HOLLYWOOD

Hollywood is an industry built by combining art with commerce. If certain movie genres make money, Hollywood makes more of them and vice versa. When the studios advertise their latest film, they almost always lean heavily into the genre. This is because audiences want to know what kind of story they’re going to be told. Movie stars are a big draw, but the type of movie is arguably the most important deciding factor.

FILM GENRES AND THEIR CONVENTIONS

So, how are movie genres constructed? We can boil the ingredients down to three essentials — plot, characters, and presentation. Subgenres like zombie movies or romantic comedies often function with recognizable patterns in their story structures, types of characters, and the formal elements of their presentation (cinematography, editing, music, etc.). 

SUBVERTING FILM GENRES

Audiences want to know what they’re getting. On the other hand, it can’t be too familiar either. There should be enough familiarity with a dash of something unexpected. And there are a number of ways filmmakers are successful at subverting film genres. One is switch genres at some point in the story. Another is to work with hybrid genres — films that blend two or more genres from start to finish. 

Once writers and directors understand these “rules” and expectations, they will be better able to deliver what the audience wants along with something unexpected.

TOP GUN MAVERICK BEHIND THE SCENES

It’s safe to say that Top Gun Maverick was one of the most successful summer blockbusters in recent memory. This was partly due to the fact that the aerial cinematography looked insanely real. That’s because it was. In this video, we’ll look at Top Gun Maverick behind the scenes and the ingenious ways they shot the aerial sequences.

Tony Scott’s original Top Gun showcased groundbreaking aerial cinematography in 1986. But they were limited by what they could shoot, especially from inside the cockpit. Fast forward 36 years, when director Joseph Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda developed an ingenious way to shoot all of the aerial sequences practically. This included a 6-camera system placed inside the cockpit. That’s right, they fit 6 Sony Venice cameras inside the cockpit with the actors.

In fact, there were three separate systems to shoot the intense aerial cinematography. Ground-to-air involved shooting planes from the ground. Air-to-air allowed other aircraft to capture footage of the jets. And as mentioned above, onboard cameras were also used with mounts inside and outside the aircraft. When combined in editing, each of these systems could capture and present the most dynamic and exhilarating aerial sequences.

With this look at Top Gun Maverick behind the scenes, we can see just how dedicated Kosinski, Miranda, and their entire crew was to present an authentic and immersive experience. These days, CGI, green screen, virtual production, and LED volume technology are becoming the new normal. But no matter how far that technology goes, there’s still nothing like the real thing.

WHAT IS AN EPILOGUE IN FILM

The epilogue is a literary device that acts almost like a second ending. It is a bit of information that brings further closure to the story, twists it with irony, or even opens it up for a sequel. But not every screenplay needs an epilogue — in fact, most writers agree that if you can wrap everything up without an epilogue, do it. In this video, we’re going to define the epilogue and dive into some of the forms it can take in a film, including text, voice-over, montage, or a final scene.

The term epilogue comes from Greek ‘epi’ meaning “additional” and ‘logos’ meaning “speech,” translating to “additional speech.” It’s the final word the author leaves with the audience. In Greek theater, this would be delivered by the chorus; in Shakespearean times, a character from the play might address the crowd directly with some concluding bit of commentary. In literature, epilogues are final chapters, usually to provide some insight into the story from a different perspective or from events that take place after the main story has ended.

HOW TO WRITE AN EPILOGUE

In film endings, the epilogue serves the same functions, but there are a variety of ways this can be done. The quickest and most common form of epilogue in film is adding on-screen text that details what happens next. For biopics and documentaries, this text epilogues can give the audience information about where the characters are now. 

Another similar type of epilogue is to use voice-over instead of text. For example, in Apollo 13, Capt. Lovell explains what caused the accident for the lunar astronauts and where each of the main characters ended up — most of whom never went to space again.

A montage is another great option for how to end a movie with an epilogue. This is something Pixar does all the time. Toy Story 3 ends with a montage of how Sunnyside Day Care has become a more welcoming place and how Bonnie’s new toys are bonding with her old toys. In WALL-E, a montage shows us how the returned passengers are able to restore life to Earth.

One final way filmmakers use the epilogue is just one final scene. Often this takes place at some point in the future, where a final moment brings new context or irony to the story. At the end of the Harry Potter series, we jump forward 19 years to show the main characters sending their own children off to Hogwarts for the first time to bring the story full circle.

As Shakespeare once advised, a good story doesn’t need an epilogue, but good stories might also benefit from having one. Some of the best film endings don't need an epilogue so as you wrap up your next script, consider whether an epilogue would either help or hurt your story.

THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO CLOSE-UP SHOTS IN FILM

Roger Ebert once said that “Movies are like a machine that generates empathy.” One of the most common and direct ways this occurs is through the close up. So much about how we communicate and connect with people is through the face. It makes sense then that the close up shot is one of the most ubiquitous camera shots. In this video, we’re going to examine the myriad of ways how to shoot a close-up, including aspect ratio, lighting, depth of field, and how to edit close-ups in a scene.

One of the decisions made during pre-production is what aspect ratio will be used. More square-shaped images are great for close-up shots because they can isolate a single face. On the other hand, more rectangle-shaped images can give more context around the character or even allow close-ups of two or three characters at a time.

Camera lenses also bring distinct qualities when shooting close-up shots in film. Lenses with a focal length of 50mm and above will tend to flatten the face, while wide-angle lenses (like 28mm and below) will stretch and distort the face. There is also lighting to consider — soft backlighting can give the character a glow, while harsh underlighting creates dramatic shadows.

When we picture a close up shot, it’s probably shot at eye level and level with the ground. But camera angles and staging can easily change the meaning of a close up. Dutch angles are a shorthand for unstable situations, while high and low angle close ups are subtle ways to inform power dynamics. 

There are endless possibilities when it comes to how to shoot a close up. And the more you understand the various nuances like lighting, framing, lensing, and editing, you’ll be better equipped to construct the perfect close up shot.

DIEGETIC VS NON-DIEGETIC SOUND EXPLAINED

Film sound comes in two basic types — diegetic vs non-diegetic. Each has a role in the cinematic experience, and in this video, we’re going to explain everything. Including the definitions of each type, their most common and not-so-common applications, and how filmmakers can use the soundtrack to tell better stories.

We always say that we “watch” movies, but have you ever really “listened” to a movie? There is quite a lot of storytelling happening on the soundtrack, but we usually take it for granted. Naturally, our eyes do the heavy lifting as they process all that visual information, but film sound is actually an unsung hero in the overall experience. 

WHAT IS DIEGETIC SOUND

To understand diegetic vs non-diegetic sound in film, we first have to understand what “diegesis” means. The concept of diegesis goes all the way back to the Ancient Greeks and it refers to “the act of narrating a story,” including the details the narrator adds or leaves out. In film, this essentially means “the world of the film and everything in it.” And when it comes to film sound, if the characters can hear it, it’s diegetic; otherwise, it’s non-diegetic.

But which is which and why does it matter? Let’s continue with a breakdown of diegetic sound.

DIEGETIC SOUND IN FILM

Again, if the characters can hear it, it’s diegetic sound — even if they only hear it in their head. This is called internal diegetic sound and includes thoughts, narration, music, etc. We can also divide diegetic sound into two subcategories: on-screen and off-screen. This refers to the source of the sound. When we hear birds in a forest scene but can’t see them, it’s still considered diegetic. 

NON-DIEGETIC SOUND IN FILM

On the other hand, non-diegetic sound is everything the characters cannot hear. This includes sound effects, some forms of narration, and, the most common element, the musical score. But sometimes sound can actually switch between diegetic vs non-diegetic, which is called trans-diegetic sound. This often helps to blur the line between fantasy and reality.

There are countless ways to use film sound to lure us into or shock us out of the cinematic experience. Now that you know the basics of diegetic vs non-diegetic sound, it’s your turn to make us truly listen to a movie.

HORROR MOVIE TROPES — MIRRORS IN HORROR MOVIES EXPLAINED

You’ve seen the mirror trope a million times in thrillers and horror movies — someone looks into a mirror, and bad things happen. The horror genre is full of movie tropes like this. But when tropes turn into cliches, they turn into bad horror movie tropes. In this video, we’re going to look at one of the most common horror movie tropes to understand the supernatural connection we have with mirrors. Along the way, we’ll offer a few options for how to make mirror scenes in horror movies actually scary again.

WHY MIRRORS IN HORROR MOVIES?

We’ve been terrified of mirrors far longer than you think. Diviners in Ancient Greece would use them to foretell the future, including their own deaths. In Chinese mythology, it is believed that what we see in a mirror isn’t a reflection of our world but a window into an alternate reality where dark creatures have learned to mimic our every move. In Judaism, after a family member has passed, mirrors in the house are covered to prevent any unwanted contact with the realm of the dead. It should be no wonder why we have seen so many mirrors in horror movies.

MIRROR TROPES

There are two variations of mirror tropes in horror movies. The first is when the medicine cabinet is closed to reveal someone (or something) standing behind the character. This used to be a guaranteed way to give the audience a sudden jolt. But it’s been so overdone now that it just may have lost all its power. Instead, we have to find new ways to catch the audience off guard. One way is to make it a surprise by using different reflective surfaces.

The second way we see mirrors in horror movies is when the character’s reflection moves independently from the character. This harkens back to our long-held superstition that our reflection is actually a wicked doppelganger. And while the first few examples might have been truly unsettling, it’s become one of many bad horror movie tropes. So, how do we make it scary? One option is to keep the effect subtle. In Nia DaCosta’s take on Candyman, we can see this in action, where the movement is so small we might even question whether or not we saw it at all.

Horror movie tropes will never die, but it might be possible to save them from losing their ability to keep us terrified.

Cinematic Lighting Techniques Explained

This episode of the Shot List series covers Part One of the basics of cinematic lighting. This includes fundamentals like the types of light, the qualities of light, essential terminology and necessary gear, and everything you need to know before you light your first scene. In Part Two, we’ll look at how to actually light subjects, backgrounds, and unique scenarios.

Cinematic lighting is something every filmmaker is after. Learning how to light a scene, interview, music video, etc. is almost always learning how to achieve “cinematic lighting.” And though cinematography in general can be daunting especially lighting, our goal here is to lay the foundation for you to be able to step on set where the real learning happens.

Cinematic lighting techniques start with knowing the various types of light and their various qualities. You should know the difference between natural and artificial light and how to best utilize both. Hard light hits the subject directly, creating sharp and distinct shadows while soft light gets diffused and scattered, creating soft and indistinct shadows.

You should know that ambient light includes any light available at a location that the crew didn’t bring and that practical lights are any sources visible in the shot. Motivated lighting means that there is a justified reason for how you’re lighting a scene. For example, if we see a firelight illuminating the subject, there should obviously be a fireplace in the room.

Another major task in cinematic lighting techniques is controlling the light. Flags and barn doors block and shape light, while diffusion materials like silks and reflectors change the quality of light from hard to soft. 

The techniques and concepts behind cinematic lighting are actually quite straightforward. And once you’ve mastered the essentials, that’s when the creativity kicks in to make them your own.

NOPE BEHIND THE SCENES

Nope is not just any other blockbuster. The techniques they used to shoot it were intended to provide a unique cinematic experience. In this video, we’re gonna take a look at the making of Nope and the technical and creative choices that contributed to such an immersive and cinematic experience.

MAKING OF NOPE — CINEMATOGRAPHY

There are a couple of aspects to the making of Nope’s cinematography that prove this is no ordinary spectacle. First, the decision to shoot the night scenes allowed for a revolutionary update to an old-fashioned technique. Day-for-night is the process of shooting night scenes during the day. Traditionally, filters and color correction could be used to simulate nighttime. But in this case, Hoytema assembled a dual-camera system that shot both infrared and color images at the same time. Then, in post-production, these are combined and manipulated to achieve something closer to how humans actually see in the dark vs. how cameras see in the dark.

Hoytema also shot the entirety of the movie using large format cameras and film stock, either 65mm or 70mm. The larger frames allow for greater detail in the image and, ideally, a more immersive experience.

MAKING OF NOPE — VISUAL EFFECTS

Obviously, there are a lot of visual effects in the film. Jean Jacket, the film’s monster, is a wildly imaginative and impossible creation achievable only with CGI. But there are other visual effects that you might not have been aware of. The clouds, for example, are completely CGI. This allowed the filmmakers complete control over the amount, shape, and coverage of the clouds. 

Another notable visual effect concerns the chimp, Gordy. For this, they employed a technique called “faux-cap, "" a type of performance capture that can be done without infrared tracking in a typical motion capture environment. Actor Terry Notary provided the base performance for Gordy while additional reference cameras were placed around the set. They also used forced perspective to make Terry chimp-sized, including hiring a much taller stand-in for comparison and building the set furniture 30% larger.

With the making of Nope, Jordan Peele and his team went out of their way to create a true spectacle. And with innovative techniques like these, they were able to do just that.

DAVID O. RUSSELL DIRECTING STYLE

Since the mid-90s, director David O. Russell has been slowly becoming one of America’s top auteurs. His filmography boasts titles such as Three Kings, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and Amsterdam. In this video, we let Russell himself explain his approach to writing and directing, including his preference for character-driven stories, music and rhythm, and the value of collaboration.

A self-proclaimed “late bloomer,” David O. Russell didn’t even pursue being a filmmaker until his late-20s. And according to him, it wasn’t until he made The Fighter, his fifth feature film, that he felt like he found his voice as a filmmaker. 

What he discovered was his love for character-driven stories. No matter their occupation or the plot, Russell aims for grounded and relatable characters at the core. The Fighter isn’t really about boxing, it’s about the relationship between brothers. Joy isn’t about the invention of a mop, it’s a chronicle of one woman’s ambition.

Another one of Russell’s goals is to bring music into the storytelling as much as possible. When you survey his films, you can see just how deliberate and purposeful his soundtracks are. In one instance, a sequence originally conceived and shot with a Led Zeppelin track was replaced at the last minute by ELO with a steady and strong rhythm. Only then did the scene come alive.

Continuing this idea of music and rhythm, Russell discusses his idea of propulsive filmmaking. When it comes to this, Russell describes his “holy trifecta” of music, camera, and emotion. And when those elements are aligned, the scenes and sequences take on undeniable momentum.

Finally, David O. Russell values collaboration. He will “take any note,” from his actors, cinematographer, editors, etc. The ethos of “best idea wins” lies at the heart of his work, and perhaps this is why he seems to get such dynamite performances from his cast.

All in all, David O. Russell is a filmmaker worth learning from. Even if it’s just how to be a confident artist and how to find your own voice.

If you’ve been tracking PT Anderson’s career, you may have noticed a significant stylistic shift between Punch-Drunk Love and There Will Be Blood. That is why we broke up his Directing Styles videos into two parts — he’s basically become a different filmmaker.

In Part One, we covered his first four films and their hyperactive, formalist style. This time, we’re covering his latest five films which are more observant, letting the performances become more interior.

One thing that remains consistent between these eras is his themes based on family. A new layer to these stories is his protagonists, who have an extraordinary amount of ambition, which becomes the greatest roadblock in their search for family.

With his production design, Anderson is clearly aiming for authenticity. All of these films are period pieces, so their worlds needed to match. Using real locations, vintage costumes, and everything else necessary to recreate the past.

Color also is used more for atmospherics than any sort of overt symbolism. Exceptions are the Master’s glowing red pajamas and Reynolds’ pink socks, which illuminate tiny corners of their personalities.

PT Anderson’s cinematography in these films is much more observational. Close-ups linger on the characters’ faces as a direct way to understand their inner turmoil. Wide shots give us a full-body performance of the characters surrounded by their environment. And the push-ins keep an observational distance but unobtrusively bring us closer to the characters.

Furthering these techniques is how PT Anderson and his editors assemble the shots. Long takes give us an uninterrupted perspective that places us in the space with the characters. The other noticeable editing technique is how we get glimpses into their thoughts, memories, and visions.

Since Anderson is focused on authenticity, the sound he uses is exactly that. He barely uses ADR and even realized the benefit of shooting on location in films like Phantom Thread, where the “sound” of the location could give the scenes a layer of authenticity.

Finally, music plays a major role in Anderson’s storytelling, both in his early and latest work. Jonny Greenwood’s symphonic dissonance or his lush romanticism gives these already complex characters additional layers.

Overall, there is no other filmmaker quite like PT Anderson, whose dedication to creating real, authentic characters in real, authentic spaces.

WHAT IS A MACGUFFIN

Perhaps no other plot device is more confusing or debated than the MacGuffin. It’s such a simple device, and yet it is difficult to understand the variations and how to apply them in a story. In this video, we’re going to break down the differences between an Alfred Hitchcock MacGuffin and a George Lucas MacGuffin. We’ll also discuss “why” you might want to use a MacGuffin in your next screenplay with a couple of tips on how to do it right.

THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK MACGUFFIN

Any discussion on the MacGuffin has to start with the late, great Alfred Hitchcock. Although the concept is said to have originated with screenwriter and Hitchcock collaborator Angus MacPhail, it is Hitchcock himself who championed the plot device. According to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin is a plot device that sets the plot in motion, but the audience doesn’t care what it is. By the end of the film, they might have even forgotten all about it. 

For Hitchcock, the MacGuffin worked splendidly for spy thrillers — the thing that everyone is after. This could be the plans for an experimental plane engine in The 39 Steps, the wine bottles containing uranium ore in Notorious, or the microfilm in North by Northwest. These items were a means to get the plot going but held little significance otherwise. Then came George Lucas who adopted the term but added a small but significant change.

THE GEORGE LUCAS MACGUFFIN

For Lucas, the MacGuffin should remain important to both the plot and the audience throughout. He employed this version of the MacGuffin in two of major franchises: Star Wars and Indiana Jones. In A New Hope, the MacGuffin is R2-D2 who holds the stolen Death Star plans. Not only is the plot kickstarted with the search for those plans, but they also become the key to the Rebellion’s destruction of the Death Star in Act Three. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Ark is the MacGuffin. And while it could have been replaced with any other priceless artifact (like a Hitchcock MacGuffin), the Ark plays a huge role in the finale.

WRITING A MACGUFFIN

So, if you’re thinking of how to write a MacGuffin in your next script, which do you choose? There are advantages and disadvantages to both variations of the plot device, so you have to decide which one will work best for you. If you’re looking for a way to start the plot but have the focus elsewhere, go with Hitchcock. If you want the MacGuffin to play a major role for the characters, plot, and audience, try the Lucas version. Either way, understanding how the MacGuffin works will make you a more knowledgeable and purposeful storyteller.

HOW TO CREATE SUSPENSE IN FILM

You know those moments in a movie when you hold your breath, your muscles tense up, and you can barely keep your eyes on the screen? There is nothing quite as thrilling as a good suspense scene. And to understand how they work, we have to pick apart their elements. In this video, we’re going to look at some of the best suspense scenes from movies. Specifically, three scenes that each use a different filmmaking element to guide the suspense: sound design, cinematography, and editing.

SOUND DESIGN FOR SUSPENSE

In Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive, there are a few white-knuckle scenes. In the pawn shop robbery, the heist happens off-screen as we simply wait outside, in the quiet, with Driver. It is the lack of sound that keeps us on edge. One of the key ingredients in suspense is uncertainty — how will this scene end? And because we hear nothing of the robbery inside, our uncertainty remains high. The gentle but insistent ticking of Driver’s watch reminds us that time is running out but the quietness overall makes it feel like something bad is going to happen. And it does.

EDITING FOR SUSPENSE

Editing is usually the star of the show when it comes to creating suspense in film. Time is another essential element and how long the editor delays the outcome dictates the amount of suspense. In John Carpenter’s remake of The Thing, the iconic blood test scene is a taut and claustrophobic set piece. With very little sound design or music, it is the editing that really builds the suspense. By keeping each shot of the suspects in the same, tight close-ups we get no relief from the tension. Additionally, this consistency of close-ups also keeps our suspicions even across all the suspects. Finally, as MacReady proceeds with the first test, we cut back and forth between the blood and the reactions over a dozen times, delaying the result and tightening the suspense.

CINEMATOGRAPHY FOR SUSPENSE

In our final example, we look at the iconic Zodiac basement scene where Graysmith finds himself in the presence of the potential killer he’s been investigating. Here, it is the cinematography, including the lighting, camera angles, and camera movement, that creates such a terrifying scenario. As soon as Graysmith realizes Mr. Vaughn might be the Zodiac, the lighting seems to shift from even and neutral to high-contrast and horror film-esque. First, he is trapped in a close-up with Vaughn looming in the background. As they enter the basement, the low angle shot brings the ceiling on top of Graysmith, trapping him even more. And the lighting on Vaughn gets more and more sinister until he disappears completely into the shadows. 

The best suspense scenes in movies use one or all of these techniques to draw out the time, elevate our uncertainty, and raise the stakes (and our heart rates).

THE RASHOMON EFFECT EXPLAINED

In 1950, legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa released Rashomon, a film that had a massive effect on filmmakers around the world. Beyond the superb acting and direction, it became significant for another reason entirely separate from filmmaking — what would later be known as the Rashomon effect. You may have heard the term before but what is the Rashomon effect? In this video, we’ll explore the origins of the term, how it works, and the various techniques storytellers can use to approximate it in their work.

WHAT IS THE RASHOMON EFFECT

The Rashomon effect is when you have “significantly different perspectives on interpretations of the same dramatic event by different eyewitnesses.” In other words, if a group of people witnesses a car accident, they will have slightly different explanations as to what happened. But how does this occur? There are two main reasons for this neurological phenomenon — our natural, implicit biases, and an imperfect memory system. Everything we experience and learn shapes how we see the world. Since no two people live the same exact life, no two people view the world in the same exact way. On top of that, the way our brain forms and recalls memories is constantly changing. And every time you remember something, you’re not actually accessing the original memory, only the most recent version of the memory.

In Kurosawa’s film, a samurai and his wife are attacked by a bandit while traveling through a forest. During the encounter, the wife is assaulted, and the samurai is dead. But rather than present a single “neutral” account of what happened, we get four different versions, one from each participant and a woodcutter who claims to have seen the whole thing. The film doesn’t reveal which of these versions is correct. And so we are left with versions of the truth but without a definitive answer. 

The film so perfectly encapsulates this phenomenon that it became its namesake.

HOW STORYTELLERS CAN MANIPULATE THE TRUTH

The impact that the Rashomon effect has had on storytelling and filmmaking has allowed these narratives to also play with these concepts like subjective truth. Some films have taken direct inspiration from Rashomon, while others have found new ways to approximate the Rashomon effect. One such technique is the unreliable narrator who, whether consciously or unconsciously, feeds the audience false information. The other effective tool is a non-linear plot that allows the story to be presented in a different order that guides, misleads, and subverts our understanding of the truth. The manipulation of memory itself has been a ubiquitous topic in plots across multiple genres.

As we grasp what the Rashomon effect means in our daily lives, storytellers can help us navigate our understanding of the truth.

EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE BREAKDOWN

A filmmaking team known as the Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) delivered one of the most creative, ambitious, and visually stunning films of the year — Everything Everywhere All At Once. And they did it with a limited crew and a paltry budget compared to other films of the same scope. But how? In this EEAAO analysis, we learn about the practical sets, props, and effects they pulled off, along with the insane process of how they were able to execute 500 VFX shots with only 7 people working in their bedrooms during the pandemic.

The first obstacle for the team behind EEAAO was to find a suitable place to shoot multiple sets and locations. They ended up in an empty mortgage company headquarters where all the IRS scenes were filmed, as well as the family’s apartment and the “alpha-verse motor home interior.” By shooting the bulk of their scenes in a single location, they could save time and money moving between different locations. 

In the film, countless universes are shown, some for less than a second, and to help keep the audience from complete confusion, the cinematography helps to differentiate them. These decisions included the color palettes for the major universes, aspect ratios, and various camera lenses. Next were the practical effects, including a talking raccoon, the hot dog hands, as well as the rather involved fight choreography. 

But for everything the Daniels and their crew were able to capture on set, there were still over 500+ VFX shots that needed to be completed in post. Again, if this were a major studio film with a massive budget, these effects could have been done by hundreds of VFX artists from multiple effects houses. Instead, they hired a group of filmmaker friends to handle the job. This allowed for cheaper VFX as well as more creative control.

With Everything Everywhere All at Once, the Daniels have proven that a low budget does not mean low creativity.

HAYAO MIYAZAKI’S MOMENTS OF SILENCE

Beyond his boundless imagination and abilities as a storyteller, one thing Hayao Miyazaki does better than anyone is silence. He’s more than just unafraid to let quietness creep into his films. He embraces those moments and often makes them the most compelling. In this Hayao Miyazaki analysis, we’ll look at these moments of silence in detail, including the Spirited Away train scene, the My Neighbor Totoro bus stop scene, and a midday picnic scene in Howl’s Moving Castle.

HAYAO MIYAZAKI INTERVIEW — ‘MA’

Around the time Spirited Away was released, Roger Ebert sat down with Miyazaki for an interview. After Ebert pointed out Miyazaki’s tendency to include scenes that seemed to exist outside of the plot, focusing more on presenting the character and the natural world around them. Miyazaki admitted that these were intentional decisions based on a concept called ‘ma’ or emptiness. When Miyazaki clapped his hands a couple of times, he explained that the “time between claps” is ‘ma.’ And that storytellers would benefit from utilizing those empty spaces to help tell richer, more immersive stories that capture characters' emotions and empathy instead of a constant drive to resolve the plot.

UNDERLINING THEME IN HOWL’S MOVING CASTLE

One of the benefits of ‘ma’ we see in Howl’s Moving Castle is the juxtaposition of two very different scenes. The first is an idyllic picnic on the shores of Star Lake as Sophie and Merkl enjoy a tranquil and peaceful afternoon. This is followed immediately by Howl soaring over the destruction of a city by airborne bombers. Man’s relationship with war is a major theme in Hayao Miyazaki films, and using these two scenes back to back is a much stronger thematic statement.

IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO

Another way Miyazaki uses ‘ma’ is to create a more immersive experience for the audience. It can be difficult for any film, especially animation, to transport the audience out of their normal lives and into the film. But in the My Neighbor Totoro bus stop scene, Miyazaki gives us the time and the silence to feel like we have joined Satsuki and Mei as they wait for their father on a drizzly night. The lack of music and the soft patter of rain lulls us into the scene in a way that most films don’t allow us the time to do.

NON-TRADITIONAL PACING IN SPIRITED AWAY

The Spirited Away train scene is perhaps the most famous scene in the movie (and perhaps in the whole of Hayao Miyazaki films overall). Coming in the middle of the third act, when the plot should be hurtling towards the climax, we find ourselves riding a quiet train with Chihiro for minutes as she contemplates everything that has happened to her and what may happen to her friend and parents if she is unable to help them. A film with traditional Hollywood pacing would not take such a break at this moment, which is what makes it so unexpected and resonant.

Hayao Miyazaki is not the first or last director to build a pause into their films, but he just might be the best.

SATYAJIT RAY DIRECTING STYLE

Satyajit Ray is one of the “founding fathers” of cinema — and his influence on the filmmaking world cannot be overstated. Not only did he single-handedly put Indian cinema on the map, but he was also the perfect auteur. With writing, producing, directing, editing, and scoring credits on most of his films, it’s completely fair to say that Satyajit Ray movies are his own. In this video, we assembled a variety of interview clips from throughout his career to let the man himself explain his process. 
In short, the Satyajit Ray directing style is centered around simplicity and the humanist vision of a filmmaker with both Western and Indian sensibilities. Ray was always intrigued by the arts. He grew up in a house full of music, and he began drawing at an early age. It was only later that he discovered cinema, which allowed him to pursue all of these artistic passions in a single medium.

Ray’s first film, Pather Panchali, is a portrait of youth so authentic and grounded, that it might easily be mistaken for a documentary. He would go on to round out his renowned Apu Trilogy with the films Aparajito and Apur Sansar. From there, he would go on to make over 30 feature films over the course of four decades. His influence is global, with fellow auteurs like Wes Anderson and Martin Scorsese claiming him as their muse.
In the video, Ray discusses his own influences like Jean Renoir and Vittorio de Sica. He explains how the lack of funding for his projects trained him to be an economical filmmaker. Ray also had a penchant for working with non-actors as well as trained thespians, learning how to adapt his direction of actors along the way. Another low-budget filmmaking technique that aided Ray’s naturalistic style is how he used available light. Whether the light was bounced in from the Sun or motivated by a single candle, this natural lighting gives his work added authenticity.

After he worked with composers like Ravi Shankar in his early films, Satyajit Ray began scoring his own films. His early passion for music had evolved into yet another branch of his creative process. He explains that he prefers to do all of these jobs himself and that he takes full responsibility for the success or failure of his films.
Overall, the Satyajit Ray directing style is the perfect example of independent filmmaking. By studying Satyajit Ray movies, their simple yet powerful storytelling techniques become clear.

Better Call Saul Cinematography Breakdown

The cinematography of Better Call Saul just might rank up there with the best photographed shows on television. More than just the “quality” of the imagery, the show’s unique visual style is a blend of various cinematic influences from The Godfather and classic Hollywood Westerns, along with the high contrast moods found in Film Noir, and the more playful shot choices and camera framing that accent the comedy. In this video essay, we hear from co-creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould alongside DP Marshall Adams and more about these decisions and how they balance all of these influences into a single vision.

The first thing you notice about the cinematography of Better Call Saul is that it doesn’t really look like television…and that’s intentional. Just like its predecessor, Breaking Bad, Gilligan and Gould wanted to give Better Call Saul a more cinematic presentation. Despite the fact that a majority of the show is shot digitally, the lighting, framing and shot choices all contribute to this cinematic look. In particular, the use of wide shots when evoking Western landscapes. They also have a tendency to let scenes play longer in these wide shots, rather than cutting between close-ups.
Lighting plays a huge role in the Better Call Saul cinematography. Just as the daytime exteriors capture the brightness of the New Mexico sun, there is also a clear inspiration from Film Noir. As it was used in those crime dramas of the ‘40s and ‘50s, similar high-contrast lighting sets the stage for Jimmy’s descent into the criminal underworld. Aiding the cinematographers in this effort are the latest digital cameras like the VariCam that can shoot in extreme low-light situations without the usual signal noise.

Finally, even though Better Call Saul ventures into dark and dramatic territory, there are comedic elements woven throughout. The most obvious ways they bring levity into the show is through the dialogue, situations, and performances. But the camera itself can also contribute. Camera placement is an immediate way this is done, specifically the odd and unexpected POVs. Whether from inside a mailbox, mounted to a rolling car, or at the bottom of a talking toilet, these playful camera angles help balance out the drama.

The cinematography of Better Call Saul is just one reason why it has quickly become one of the best shows on television. Even with all the clear reference points, the show has crafted a visual style all its own.

WHAT IS DENOUEMENT

The denouement in a story is that last bit of storytelling after the climax has concluded. It’s the story’s last chance to wrap up loose plot points, harken back to the theme, and bring a sense of closure and resolution to the narrative. In other words, writing a denouement might just be the most important part of the storytelling process. In this video, we’ll look at some examples of denouement from The Departed, Midsommar, The Shining, Inside Llewyn Davis, and Hell or High Water to see the various ways how to end a movie.

LET’S DEFINE DENOUEMENT

Denouement is a French term that literally means the act of “untying.” Think of how tangled and complicated things get between the plot, the characters, and the obstacles in their way as the story moves forward. Then when the dust settles from the climax, the storyteller can begin untying all those threads. Three goals can be considered when writing a denouement: to conclude the conflict, recall the theme, and deliver the resolution. There is no magic formula for writing an ending; each story brings its own specific ratio between these considerations. In fact, some films end without a denouement at all. Let’s look at some examples of denouement and how they approach their endings.

EXAMPLES OF DENOUEMENT

The Departed ending is a fantastic example of how to end a movie. The Departed denouement hits all three of these goals in the last two pages of the screenplay and the last 4 minutes of the film. It concludes the conflict — Sullivan seems to have emerged as the victor, and his secret as a mob spy remains intact. It delivers resolution, especially between Sullivan and his failed relationship with Madolyn, and also by Dignam bringing satisfactory vengeance by ending Sullivan’s life. It also recalls the theme — both Costigan and Dignam were attempting to transcend their social status, but by taking on false identities, they both ended in ruin. The final shot of the Massachusetts State House (Sullivan’s ideal of the perfect life) along with a scurrying rat help bring the theme to the fore.

But the use of denouement should be tailor-made for every screenplay. Hell or High Water ends with resolution and theme, but there remains an unsettled conflict between Toby and Marcus. The Shining concludes the main conflict but complicates its resolution by asking more questions rather than providing all the answers. Midsommar skips the denouement entirely, ending during the climax, but we do get a hint of resolution in the final shot. And Inside Llewyn Davis forgoes any real narrative resolution and instead uses the denouement to highlight the theme of the film — if he doesn’t become a better person, Llewyn is doomed to repeat the same mistakes.

These examples of denouement illustrate the variety of options you have when deciding how to write a great ending. Some stories truly benefit from a thorough denouement, while others are better off leaving resolution, conflict, or themes unfinished.

Steven Spielberg Directing Style

The genius of Steven Spielberg can be tricky to explain, but it cannot be understated. How Steven Spielberg makes movies is unlike any other director before or since. From the stories he tells to the immersive, cinematic experiences he constructs for the audience, there’s just nothing quite like him. In this video, we’re going to break down the Steven Spielberg directing style into seven categories: story, production design, color, cinematography, editing, sound, and music.

Spielberg has a knack for telling stories about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. He’s not the only filmmaker to tell these stories but what makes him stand out is his ability to transpose that extraordinary experience to the audience watching. We are just as awed and transported as the characters, and Spielberg’s masterful storytelling is the culmination of all these elements.

First up is the production design and how Spielberg uses the concept of scale. Everything is big, from the threats themselves (like sharks, aliens, fascism) to the settings around the characters. Color is one of the most important elements in production design but also a relatively underused element with the Steven Spielberg directing style. He will use it like many other filmmakers to help mediate the tones in his films (which can vary greatly). But he also uses color to draw the eye. Consider how he uses red wardrobe to draw our attention to specific characters in films like Schindler’s List, The Color Purple, and Empire of the Sun.

A large part of Steven Spielberg’s directing style is his camerawork. Nobody moves the camera like him, and his ‘oners’ are legendary. Not only does he capture multiple compositions in a single shot, he instinctively knows how to keep the audience engaged and up-to-speed. Paired with these long takes is Spielberg’s editing that blends these shots together invisibly. This is the strategy behind continuity editing — to create a seamless presentation to help ensure immersion in the film.

Finally, there’s sound and music. For Spielberg, sound design is both dynamic and specific. In Jurassic Park, we hear the quietest sounds like the ripple of water, and this is followed by a deafening roar of the T-Rex. The quiet puts the audience directly into the jeep to match the character’s experience with our own. He will also use sound to isolate a character or an idea, like the ticking clocks in Lincoln as a constant reminder of the pressing issues at hand. Music is a massive part of the Steven Spielberg directing style, largely due to his long-time composer John Williams. Williams is a lavish composer with swirling melodies that sweep us away to these extraordinary worlds.

Hopefully, by the end of this video, you’ll be able to appreciate the genius of Steven Spielberg a little bit more. We’ve only scratched the surface on how Steven Spielberg makes movies which just goes to show that he is perhaps the greatest director of our lifetime.

Stranger Things Cinematography Breakdown

The cinematography of Stranger Things is a conscious and direct homage to the sci-fi and horror films of the 1980s. Creators the Duffer Brothers and their primary cinematographer Tim Ives used every aspect of cinematography towards this goal — the lighting, color, lenses, aspect ratio, and more. In this Stranger Things cinematography breakdown, we’ll look at each of these aspects and how they contribute to the overall look and feel of the show.

Stranger Things Lighting Techniques

Inspired by the work of DP Allen Daviau, especially the films he shot for Steven Spielberg, Tim Ives did a number of tricks to emulate the lighting. For example, using high color contrast for interiors (warm inside, cool outside) and using book lights to create softer illumination. 

Color in Stranger Things Cinematography

The first three seasons of the show saw a dramatic shift in the color palette. The first season is much more subtle and desaturated compared to the second and third seasons. The latter of which saw the inclusion of more neon lights and saturated colors more reminiscent of the teen comedies of the ‘80s like Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
 
Cinematic Look and Feel of Stranger Things Cinematography

The camera and lenses themselves help bring all of these aesthetics together. Despite shooting on digital cameras like the Red Dragon, the lenses were tested specifically to match those used by these influential films. Coupled with the cameras and lenses used in Stranger Things, a subtle film grain was added in Post-Production to give it a more filmic look. And the aspect ratio was decided on 2:1, which is more reminiscent of cinema than television.

All in all, the Duffer Brothers and Tim Ives have made purposeful and aesthetic choices when designing the cinematography of Stranger Things. By using everything from the lighting to the aspect ratio, they have fused their influences into something all its own.

Quentin Tarantino Food Scenes

Food in Quentin Tarantino movies isn’t an accident or an afterthought. Everything a character eats and drinks is a deliberate choice for one or all of the following reasons: to build characterization, to create relationships between characters, or to amplify tonal shifts. In this video, we’re going to bite into everything going on in Quentin Tarantino food scenes to see if we can come up with a recipe for how he uses this motif.

Food scenes in movies are a dime a dozen but the actual food and drinks are typically treated as set dressing, or as busy work for the actors while the dialogue drives the scenes. Food in Quentin Tarantino movies also functions this way but that’s just the beginning. We learn a little more about these characters by their preferred food and drink. Think of Jules’ aversion to pork in Pulp Fiction or how much Ordell from Jackie Brown loves screwdrivers. These small details help make Tarantino’s characters more specific and interesting.

Another way we see food in Quentin Tarantino movies is how it is used to create or enhance the relationships between characters. Sometimes, this is a romantic relationship — like Clarence and Alabama in True Romance having pie. But more often than not, Quentin Tarantino food scenes become a stage for power dynamics to play out. Hans Landa uses the opulence of strudel with creme as a form of control over Shoshanna. Pai Mei rewards his tutee with rice only after Beatrix struggles and succeeds with the chopsticks. And, of course, Jules taking a huge bite out of Brett’s Big Kahuna Burger is the ultimate power move.

The final way we see food in Quentin Tarantino movies is even more unique and specific. And that is to create maximum contrast between food and violence. As Tarantino admits in an interview, he relishes playing the audience like an orchestra and shifting tones on a dime. Sometimes this is done with humor but he also employs food and drink for the same purpose. One minute, the characters are enjoying an indulgent meal, and the next minute they find themselves in a bloodbath. By mixing the pleasures of food with the pain of violence, Tarantino creates extreme contrast, subverts expectations, and gives the audience his one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. This is the power of Quentin Tarantino food scenes.

Film Composition Explained

With their origins in fine art, the elements of composition in film provide a foundation for visual storytelling. In this video, the latest in our Shot List series, we’re going to explore cinematic composition and its seemingly endless possibilities. 

What is Composition?

Composition is simply how you arrange the elements of your image. This includes your subject and the space surrounding them, the size and shapes, the color and contrast, the leading lines created to help guide the viewer’s eye, and so many more. By understanding the elements of composition in film, you can execute your visual storytelling on a whole new level. 

Elements of Composition

There are many “rules” and guidelines when it comes to composition. But no matter which of these composition techniques you use, the goal is always to understand what you want the viewer to take away from a particular image. Creating focal points is a highly valuable skill so that you can guide the viewer’s attention where you want it. This can be done with “leading lines,” creating shapes, the rule of thirds, and even using color and contrast.

There are also framing and composition techniques like “frame within a frame” that helps isolate your main subject. Another technique is the Golden Ratio which uses a pattern we find everywhere in nature to create a sense of balance.

We can also look at how to use depth in the image, creating a sense of space using foreground, middle and background elements. And, of course, the angle of the camera creates its own bias and influence on how the audience perceives a composition.

Learning all of these elements of composition in film at once is certainly a daunting task. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll be able to operate on a more intuitive level where film composition becomes second nature.

Alfred Hitchcock and the Long Take

As a director, Alfred Hitchcock was always pushing his medium forward. When sound was introduced, he was one of the first to capitalize on this new storytelling tool. And, in 1948, with more than 20 years of filmmaking behind him, Hitchcock would make his most experimental film to date. 

Rope is a claustrophobic thriller set in a single apartment in real-time. Hitchcock also shot the film using a series of long takes and minimal editing. In this Rope film analysis, we’re going to investigate how Hitchcock was able to keep us engaged and in suspense using long takes, blocking and staging, and editing.

Long Takes

Rope is comprised of 11 shots, ranging from two minutes to ten minutes in length. Perhaps the most obvious way to keep a ten-minute shot engaging is to move and rearrange the camera and characters. Going further, Hitchcock also changes the shot size and framing to keep the image fresh. And the final way Hitchcock keeps long takes engaging is by using off-screen audio to expand the world outside the frame.

Blocking and Staging

Not only does Alfred Hitchcock keep his long takes active and immersive, but he also uses blocking and staging to create suspense. More than just “a photographed play,” Hitchcock uses the camera to give the viewer a more subjective experience. For example, when Philip breaks a glass in a panic, we see this happen but the audience is unaware. Or when Rupert starts to suspect foul play, the camera pushes in on his reactions.

Editing

The popular myth about Alfred Hitchcock’s Rope is that it is meant to look like one long take. But this just isn’t true. As mentioned earlier, there are in fact 11 shots in the film and only half are meant to be unseen. These “invisible” cuts happen when the camera swings behind a character, blacking out the frame. The “visible” cuts, however, are hiding in plain sight. But rather than random moments for these cuts, Hitchcock does choose strategic places for them. For example, when Mrs. Wilson interrupts Rupert’s questioning, the break in suspense helps hide the shift in the shot from one to the next.

All in all, Alfred Hitchcock considered Rope to be a failed experiment but that doesn’t mean there isn’t much to learn from it. A pioneer in the use of long takes in film, Rope stands as the perfect example of how to keep them engaging and suspenseful.

Tenet Fight Scene Breakdown

The Tenet fight scene truly expanded the possibilities of what an action scene could look and feel like. By combining forward and reverse motion, director Christopher Nolan and his editor Jennifer Lame helped craft one of the most unique showdowns. But perhaps the most interesting lesson Nolan has given us is how the concept of “perspective” works in film generally and in a fight scene specifically. In this video, we’re going to break down the Tenet freeport fight scene by looking at how subtle changes in composition & framing, editing, and even sound design help create the same fight from two different perspectives.

Framing & Composition

The first difference between Fight 1 and Fight 2 is that much of the action is shot from opposite angles. By shooting each fight from different sides of the 180-degree line, the audience is subconsciously aware that we’re perceiving the fight differently than we did the first time.
One simple trick Nolan does in this thrilling Tenet fight scene is to keep the main subject of each fight center-framed. Granted, the combatants are constantly moving but there are clear moments when efforts are made to keep our eyes focused on the subject in the center of the image. This is especially obvious when the camera moves in unison with the subject, maintaining that center-framed composition.

Editing

Another trick to creating two different perspectives is by cutting to single shots of the main subject. Since most of the Tenet fight scene has both characters on-screen simultaneously, any cut to a single helps tip the perspective scales towards that character. For example, in Fight 1 we cut to the Suit character throwing a barrage of punches; in the corresponding moment in Fight 2, we cut to a single of the Soldier defending against them.

Another editing trick we find in the Tenet fight scene is the use of POV and reaction shots. This combination of POV/reaction is the foundation of film grammar and the audience knows that in these moments, we are seeing what the character sees and their reaction. This simple technique puts the audience in the mindset of the character and, therefore, aligns our perspective with theirs.

Sound Design

Finally, Nolan uses different sound designs for each fight to give the audience a different perspective. In Fight 1, we hear the scene more objectively, as if we were in the room with the characters. Any vocalization we hear is usually from the Suit but, in Fight 2, this is reversed. Now we hear a much more subjective sound design, as we hear what the Soldier hears. The muffled breathing, the compressed air of his gas mask, etc. 

None of these techniques are very obvious, and by themselves might not be as effective. But in combination, with these subtle differences in framing & composition, editing, and sound design, we are given two distinct perspectives on the same fight. These techniques are applicable to any scene in any movie but, as you can see, are very effective in such situations as the Tenet inverted fight scene.

Euphoria Cinematography Breakdown

If there’s one aspect that stands out with HBO’s Euphoria, it’s the imagery. From the lighting, camera movement, and long takes, everything about Euphoria’s cinematography is designed to capture “emotional realism.” In this video, we’re going to look inside these elements to see just how this is achieved.

Euphoria Cinematography Lighting

The lighting in Euphoria is both dynamic and colorful, intended to highlight the heightened emotions of the characters. Most of the time, bold primary colors are used. And in some cases, the mixing of colors enhances the effect. For example, nighttime lighting blends blueish moonlight with warm yellow tungsten streetlights. And during the second season, the decision was made to shoot on film, which further enhanced the color palettes. That’s why the cinematography of Euphoria Season 2 looks so different from the first season.

Euphoria Cinematography Camera Movement

Camera movement is also a huge part of the overall Euphoria cinematography. As cinematographer Marcell Rév explains, the moving camera brought a certain energy that ties the different storylines together. Not only is the camera as active as the characters, but it also brings us directly into their mental state. Consider the moment in the pilot as the hallway literally spins around Rue as she experiences an “altered state.”

Euphoria Cinematography Long Takes

The final key element bringing all of the Euphoria cinematography together is the use of long takes. Often these long takes move in and out of rooms, connecting characters in a single shot and creating unity between all of their experiences. The biggest set-piece is the now-iconic carnival scene where dollys, cranes, and Steadicams were used to capture the spectacle all in “oner.”

What filmmakers like Sam Levinson and Marcell Rév have made is a loud and vibrant ode to the chaos of youth. Euphoria cinematography is defined as big and bold but it’s not done for its own sake. It is used to capture the inner and outer emotions of characters in crisis and change.

Sicario Border Scene Breakdown

The Sicario border scene is one of those scenes that stick with you. Whether it's the hold-your-breath tension or the brutal and unceremonious violence, there’s no denying this is a well-crafted scene. In this Sicario video essay, we’re going to run through the border scene standoff and shootout to see how director Denis Villeneuve directed tension and trauma.

Denis Villeneuve’s Approach to Violence

In an interview about the Sicario border scene, Villeneuve had this to say. “I wanted to have the same approach to violence that I have had in my previous films, which is to seize the point of view of the victims. I wanted to show the brutality of violence, its ugliness, without glorifying it or creating too much of a spectacle.” In this case, the victim in question is actually Kate Mercer, the idealistic FBI agent who is traumatized by the violent shootout and the moral compromises being made. So how does Villeneuve accomplish both the unglamorous violence and the trauma that Kate experiences?

Sicario Analysis

There are a few tactics happening in this scene — the calm and controlled camera work punctuated by brief moments of disorienting, rapid-fire editing and gunfire. As the border bandits make their move, they are quickly surrounded on all sides by Delta Force operators. As they exit the SUV, Villeneuve cuts between six different shots in seven seconds, all from different angles. Something as mundane as characters exiting a vehicle shouldn’t be so jarring but there’s a reason for this presentation — to make us as panicked and disoriented as Kate is in that moment.

Then the bandits in the red Impala pull their guns but are swiftly executed. Again, we get another quick burst of shots (5 cuts in 3 seconds) — the brutality of the action is enhanced by the jarring edits — and then we cut to Kate’s incredulous reaction. Once again, the operators dispatch the second car of would-be assassins and the pattern repeats with disorienting cuts followed by Kate’s reaction. The scene ends with a final mini-burst of violence, this time as Kate herself fires her weapon.

As Villeneuve described, we have a tense scene but the violence is treated as coldly and brutally as possible. There is no spectacle or glorifying the violence here — just a swift and startling experience for both Kate and the audience.

Special effects are the definition of movie magic. And it is the work of creative and technical wizards like Chris Corbould that execute some of the best explosions, car chases, and vehicles in Hollywood’s biggest movies. In this video, we sat down with Chris Corbould to pick his brain on his role in a production, some of his favorite effects he’s done, and the secrets behind them. We’ll cover everything from The Dark Knight truck flip and The Bat from The Dark Knight Rises to the Skyfall subway chase and the No Time to Die Matera chase sequence.

First off, we have to make something clear. Special effects are not the same as visual effects, even though those terms get used interchangeably. Special effects cover everything produced on set — including rain, explosions, prosthetics, vehicles, etc. Visual effects, on the other hand, are all done in post-production — including CGI, compositing, motion capture, etc. Of course, in many cases, the final effect on screen is a combination of those two departments.

Corbould explains that in Skyfall, director Sam Mendes needed a thrilling conclusion to the underground subway chase. His pitch was to have subway cars crash through the ceiling of the underground tunnel. What was first conceived of as a miniature shot quickly turned into a full-sized production with train cars riding along a monorail system in the ceiling, smashing through everything.

In No Time to Die, the breakneck chase through Matera came with a number of challenges. For one, this actual location is a centuries-old city that had to be protected. Along with CG cars and explosions, Corbould and his team did much of the action practically. Building fake walls for bullet hits as Bond drives his DB5 in a 360-degree spin. 

For The Dark Knight truck flip, the question was whether they could actually flip a full-sized semi-truck or not. But with some extensive testing, a system was devised to do just that. The final result is one of those bravura moments that director Christopher Nolan is known for thanks in large part to Corbould and his team. In The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan wanted a new vehicle for the Caped Crusader — The Bat, what looks like a flying batmobile. At first, Corbould was convinced that it would have to be done with CGI. But as they started building the vehicle, he devised ways to actually use it on set. This included using a massive zip line to fly The Bat up and down city streets as well as mounting it on top of a driving vehicle that could be painted out in post.

If you’ve seen a Hollywood action movie, you’ve seen the work of Special Effects Supervisors like Chris Corbould. For everything that CGI can accomplish, there’s nothing quite like the real thing. The next time you see a hospital demolished like in The Dark Knight or a building sinking into a canal-like in Casino Royale, you can appreciate the power of special effects.

Film Exposition Explained

What is exposition in screenwriting and why do writers struggle with it? In this video, we’ll investigate this necessary evil that plagues even the best writers. Including some basic strategies on how to deliver exposition organically to the audience and some ideas of where exposition can be more effective. 

In general, bad exposition is noticed by the audience and good exposition slips by without drawing attention. But how is this done? Every movie has to find its own way of how to deliver exposition in screenwriting but there are some general do’s and don’ts you can try on any script.
The Do’s and Don’ts of Writing Exposition

In writing exposition, there are at least four different approaches to make it work. The first is to disguise the information — Hitchcock said that exposition is a “pill that must be sugar-coated” so that the audience doesn’t realize they are receiving it. The second is to visualize the information, which goes back to a sacred commandment in screenwriting: show, don’t tell. In other words, if we can see it, there’s no need to explain it. The third method is to delay the information as long as possible. 

Instead of telling the audience everything in Act One, saving some pieces will lure the audience in with anticipation. Finally, perhaps the most underused approach to writing exposition is to NOT deliver it at all. Ask yourself: does the audience really need to know this? What would happen if it was left unexplained? In many cases, this creates a more interesting and engaging form of storytelling.

How to Deliver Exposition

Because we’re working in film, there are many areas through which narrative exposition can be delivered. These include the more obvious outlets like on-screen text, narration and dialogue. But there are also opportunities that writers should explore, including the mise-en-scene or the media. But there is a fine line between using any of these elements for exposition — each can be unnatural or overdone and finding that balance is indeed tricky.

Writing exposition cannot be avoided but with these techniques, it can be managed and strategically employed to tell better and more immersive stories.

Making of Titanic Sinking Scene

James Cameron’s Titanic is perfectly named. The scope and budget of his film were equaled only by the building of the RMS Titanic herself. But the most fascinating aspect of the making of Titanic was the mix of massive sets, practical special effects, and cutting-edge CGI. Together they produced a kind of spectacle that Hollywood may never make the same way again. In this video, we’re going to focus on the Titanic sinking scene and the incredible story behind its making.

First, there were the sets themselves. In a brand new studio built in Rosarito, Mexico, specifically for the production of James Cameron’s Titanic, a nearly full-sized replica of the ship was constructed. To accommodate the Titanic sinking scene, the ship was also built in sections that could be used for specific actions during the sinking. The bow section could be tilted down and actually submerged into the tank. And the stern section was mounted on a separate hydraulic rig that could tilt it up at 90 degrees for the ship’s final, vertical descent into the water.

But to capture the size of the set, there didn’t exist a camera crane large enough. In typical James Cameron fashion, he didn’t go home, he went big. He mounted cameras onto a massive construction crane that could ride along train tracks like the world’s biggest camera dolly. Hanging from the crane was a platform that could also be raised and lowered with a Wescam mounted underneath. 

For certain shots of the Titanic sinking scene, miniatures were used. For example, when the stern rises up out of the water, two old-school techniques were employed to help sell the illusion. First, a miniature was shot at between 60-75 frames per second and, second, a foreground shot of extras floating in the water underneath it.

Also, in typical James Cameron fashion, they pushed the limits of what CGI could accomplish in 1997. This included one of the earliest uses of motion-capture performances, a digital ocean, and stitching the practical set with miniatures and CG portions of the ship in the same shot. The full-sized set could only be tilted at 6 degrees, much shallower than what they needed. So, a simple solution was found — Dutch angle the camera and composite in a new water/horizon line. 

All in all, the Titanic Sinking Scene is a marvel to behold. From the old-school techniques to the revolutionary visual effects, it is perhaps the apex of Hollywood movie magic. Sadly, since CGI can do just about anything these days, this type of filmmaking may have sunk along with Jack and the ill-fated RMS Titanic.

Plato's Allegory of the Cave — A Storyteller's Guide to Using Allegory

Plato’s Allegory of the Cave was written over 2,000 years ago — so why are we still talking about it today? As part of his larger work, The Republic, Plato’s Allegory of the Cave is a simple story with a complex message. And in this video, we’re going to descend deep into the cave and emerge enlightened. We’ll break down Plato's cave allegory, the various interpretations, the films that were directly inspired by it, and what writers today can take away from it.

Allegory of the Cave Summary

Plato’s allegory can be summed up as a conversation between two characters, Socrates and Glaucon. To illustrate a point he is making about the role of philosophy in government, Socrates offers up this allegory.

A group of prisoners is chained inside a cave their entire lives. On the wall in front of them, shadows are projected — because this is all they know, these shadows are their reality. Then one of these prisoners is set free and turns around to see the truth. The shadows are created by men carrying statues and shapes of things in front of a fire. 

The freed prisoner then ascends the rest of the way out of the cave. In the open sunlight, his eyes are temporarily blinded. But as his vision adjusts, he begins to see this new reality — instead of the shadow of a tree, he sees an actual tree. With this newfound knowledge and enlightenment, the prisoners descend back into the cave to share their findings with the rest of the prisoners. But his eyes are now adjusted to the light, and he is essentially blind once again in the dark. The other prisoners see this as madness and actually threaten the freed prisoner if he attempts to put them through the same experience.

The Allegory of the Cave Analysis

In writing The Republic, one of the purposes was to discuss how a utopian society could be formed. Platos Allegory of the Cave was part of a larger point that this proposed society would be ruled by those who have “seen the light.” But there are many other ways to interpret the allegory. Allegories, by definition, use symbolism to present themes that might otherwise be too complicated or controversial without it. And the very nature of symbolism allows room for interpretation.

We’ve seen movies take direct inspiration from Plato’s Allegory of the Cave (The Matrix, The Truman Show, Us) but what writers and screenwriters can also takeaway from this is how to use allegories to tell their stories.

How They Shot It — Inception Hallway Fight Scene

What was going through your mind the first time you saw the Inception hallway fight scene? Chances are it was some form of the question: “How did they shoot that?” In this video, we are going to break down the sets, camera rigs, stunts and special effects that Christopher Nolan and his team employed to create the Inception hallway fight scene…without CGI.

Inception Spinning Hallway

The most complicated part of the Inception hallway fight scene was the sets themselves. Taking a cue from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Christopher Nolan had a radical idea — to build a rotating set (two, in fact). Both the hallway set and the hotel room set could be rotated along the horizontal plane to simulate the shifting gravity. Then for the zero-gravity scenes, a new identical hallway set was built vertically.

Camera Rigs and Lighting

Two different camera systems were used in the spinning hallway. The first was a floor-mounted dolly that was attached to hidden rails in the floor,, which rotated with the set. The second was a Technocrane arm that was operated independently of the set, which allowed the camera to actually see the rotation of the hallway. The lighting was entirely practical — the light fixtures you see in the hallway were the actual sources of illumination.

Zero Gravity

For the zero-gravity shots, using the vertical set, the camera simply tilted up 90 degrees looking straight down (up) the hallway. Then the actors could lowered with a wire rig system that made them look like they were floating “forward” instead of “down.” The same technique was used for the hotel room in zero-gravity and the only CGI necessary was to paint out the wires. One final detail that helped sell this illusion was from costume designer Jeffrey Kurland, who stiffened the moveable parts of the costume like shoelaces and pant legs that would otherwise “betray” the illusion.

The Inception hallway fight scene will go down as one of the greatest examples of special effects filmmaking. Granted, it was only possible with a massive budget but the spirit of the low-fi, old-school trickery can be applied anywhere.

What is foreshadowing?

What is foreshadowing in films and how do filmmakers use it to build intrigue? In this video, we present a foreshadowing lesson for filmmakers and storytellers. Not only covering the difference between direct foreshadowing and indirect foreshadowing but how these techniques can be applied. From the obvious applications of foreshadowing like dialogue down to the details like props, music, and production design.

Foreshadowing Definition

At the basic level, foreshadowing is anything that indicates or hints at future events in a story. Between the two types of foreshadowing, we either recognize these hints right away or only in hindsight. But in either case, it can create a cohesive story in which the audience becomes intrigued at how it will all turn out.

What is direct foreshadowing?

Direct foreshadowing is obvious to the audience right away. But even then, there is a spectrum of presentations — from clear indications of what will happen later in the story to simply hints that leave room for ambiguity or subversion. For example, in The Tragedy of Macbeth, the witches state outright that Macbeth will one day take the throne. But rather than ruining the ending, we are more intrigued by how he slowly corrupts his soul in the process. 

In Frozen, we are told that the only way to cure Anna’s curse is through “an act of true love.” The filmmakers use our expectations of a “romantic” love but it is revealed that it is a sister’s love that breaks the spell.
What is indirect foreshadowing?

Indirect foreshadowing is only obvious in hindsight, either at the end of the film or upon a second viewing. This is different from easter eggs, which are deliberately hidden inside jokes or clues but have little to no bearing on the actual plot. For example, in Ari Aster’s horror fairy tale Midsommar, the first image we see is pure indirect foreshadowing. We open with a mural that lays out the entire plot of the film. Of course, we can’t recognize that before we’ve seen the film but it works as indirect foreshadowing nonetheless. It gives the tragedy a sense of inevitability — that Dani was always meant to find herself among the Harga and that the demise of her friends was similarly foretold.

Foreshadowing in films is everywhere and if you’re looking for tips on how to write foreshadowing in your next script, these examples should give you a head start. It is a skill that all storytellers, no matter the medium or genre, can use to bring the audience into the narrative.

Wes Anderson's Symmetry Explained

Symmetry in Wes Anderson movies is no secret but this is not your typical Wes Anderson symmetry video. Anyone who watches Wes Anderson movies (particularly his later work) can see immediately that he loves a symmetrical frame. But Wes Anderson symmetry goes well beyond simple framing — he also edits symmetrically. In this breakdown, we explore how Wes Anderson uses symmetry in movies in his shot types, compositions, blocking & staging, and the timing & pacing.

Symmetry in Wes Anderson Movies

As we’ve seen, Anderson’s frames are highly composed and often center-framed. And when he cuts between these equally centered frames, it creates a strong visual rhythm that keeps the audience focused on the characters and his snappy dialogue. The connection this symmetrical editing creates can be used for characters in love or characters at odds. Sometimes, instead of mirror-image shots edited back to back, Anderson will edit between complementary compositions to create a similar connection. 

Anderson will also match the blocking and staging from one shot to the next. For example, Suzy and Sam in Moonrise Kingdom are often shot and edited using these symmetrical editing techniques. Consider the scene in which they jump into the lake from opposite directions. Each shot of them alternates between nearly identical blocking and staging, suggesting just how in sync these young romantics are.

Finally, we can also see a major element of Wes Anderson editing techniques in the timing of each shot. In some cases, the editing is timed to deliver Anderson’s punchy dialogue quickly and sharply with nearly identical shot lengths. In other cases, however, like the opening credits in The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson and his editor Dylan Tichenor cut each character’s title card at the very same length, down to the frame. 

The symmetry in Wes Anderson movies is superficially just an aesthetic choice. But when you consider how the symmetrical editing factors in, you can see (and feel) the specific and precise rhythm of Anderson’s work.

The cinematography of Zack Snyder movies is chock full of amazing shots. Indeed, the signature Zack Snyder style is defined by exquisitely crafted and choreographed images. In this video breakdown, we’re looking at three elements of Zack Snyder’s visual style that work in combination to create such imagery. 

Zack Snyder Visual Style — Speed Ramping

Perhaps the most well-known and immediate quality of Zack Snyder’s cinematography is how he uses frame rate. He uses slow-motion like anyone else — to give each moment emphasis and drama. But where he carved out a niche for himself is the use of speed ramping, or changing the frame rate in the middle of a shot. By switching back and forth between fast, normal and slow-motion, Snyder not only creates physics-defying action, it generates a specific rhythm that doesn’t rely so much on editing.

Zack Snyder Visual Style — High Contrast

Then we can talk about the “look” of Zack Snyder’s cinematography. With 300, they developed a complicated recipe for creating the film’s high-contrast look. And it has become a staple of the Zack Snyder style ever since. This begins with low-key lighting — where the subjects are often “backlit” with little-to-no fill light. This essentially makes them silhouettes. Then in post-production, they can “crush” the image even further to make the blacks deeper and the highlights brighter.

Zack Snyder Visual Style — Shallow Depth of Field

Finally, the last piece needed to emulate the cinematography of Zack Snyder is shallow depth of field. Instead of action sequences that allow the entire frame to be in focus, Snyder keeps things more intimate. We’ll see objects like a gun or rain droplets isolated with close-ups in shallow focus. This keeps the action focused, keeps the audience engaged, and also elevates the subjects even higher. All of these techniques in Zack Snyder’s cinematography are designed to create the most epic and aesthetic shots possible.

None of these techniques require a large budget, which should be encouraging for those filmmakers looking to capture something akin to Zack Snyder’s visual style in their own projects.

The typical David Fincher color palette isn’t very colorful. Exceptions aside, Fincher typically forgoes any bright or saturated colors for something much more subdued. Beyond a simple aesthetic choice, there is also storytelling value within a David Fincher color palette. A filmmaker as precise as Fincher doesn’t leave any decision unconsidered so what is behind his choice of colors? In this video, we’ll hear from Fincher and his collaborators on color in David Fincher movies and how it fits into his overall approach.

The David Fincher Color Palette — Desaturation

If there is one consistent trait to a David Fincher color palette, it is desaturation. As Production Designer Arthur Max explains, Se7en is a “no-color color movie.” Creating such a muted and controlled palette, especially away from primary and vibrant colors, has a number of effects. One effect is that when a bold color is used, the audience will notice it. In Se7en, it also allows the appearance of bright red to stand out even more — which is reserved for blood, John Doe, and the relationship between them.

David Fincher's Color — Characters

Fincher will often attach color to a character. In The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, the color red was used exclusively for Daisy. In Se7en, Det. Somerset is surrounded by dark colors. In his apartment, we get dark Earth tones and deep greens to match his pessimistic worldview. 

Color in David Fincher Movies — Settings

Where Fincher does make pronounced choices in his color palette is in settings. Often he will wash the entire room in a single color — like the nostalgic yellow in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or the oppressive orange heat in Alien 3. For the “Sloth” crime scene in Se7en, cinematographer Darius Khondji explains how they used green in the lighting to give the scene a “moist, fungal” look.

The David Fincher color palette isn’t bold or even that visually appealing but that’s the point. To create the dark and dangerous moods of his subject matter, it makes perfect sense to let color become equally dark.

Interrogation scenes in movies have one goal in mind — to get information. One side needs it and the other is typically resistant to giving it. Other than resorting to physical violence, interrogators often rely on psychological attacks, otherwise known as mind games. In this interrogation scene video essay, let’s explore three different mind games that screenwriters have been employing with great success. To do this, we’ll look at the work of filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, and the Coen Brothers.

How to Write an Interrogation Scene

In a previous video, we techniques and tips on how to direct an interrogation scene. Now, let’s talk about how to write an interrogation scene using three effective techniques: Good Cop/Bad Cop, External Threat, and Deception. Each brings a degree of psychological warfare to interrogation scenes, which are commonly presented as a battle of wills.

Good Cop/Bad Cop Interrogation Scenes

First, we have Good Cop/Bad Cop — a role-playing strategy that requires two interrogators to enact different demeanors. When the verbal or physical threats from the Bad Cop prove overwhelming for the suspect, they become much more agreeable to working with the mild-mannered and reasonable Good Cop. This type of interrogation scene in movies has been done ad nauseum but there are ways to subvert the expectations, especially for comedy.

External Threat Interrogation Scenes

Sometimes, threatening the suspect personally has little to no effect. But when that same threat is applied externally to something or someone they care about, they just might change their tune. The typical set-up includes using the life of the love interest character as a bargaining chip. This puts the suspect into a difficult situation — give up their information or watch their loved one suffer.

Deception Interrogation Scenes

The final option employs some degree of deception by the interrogators. This could be a simple lie, a fabricated piece of evidence, or an elaborate ruse that gives the suspect no option but to confess. Ethics aside, this type of interrogation scene in movies can be highly effective, both for the audience and suspect when neither is aware of the deception until the big reveal.
Interrogation scenes in movies and television are a dime a dozen but with a little twist on familiar techniques, they can be refashioned into something intelligent and entertaining.

300 First Battle Scene Breakdown

It’s highly likely that when you saw 300’s first battle (aka the Hot Gates Battle), a single question came to mind. How did they shoot that? From the speed ramps to the morph zooms, there is a lot going on in this single-take fight scene, nicknamed the “Crazy Horse Shot.” In this 300 behind-the-scenes video, we’ll explain everything, including the ingenious idea Zack Snyder had to pull it off.

Zack Snyder’s 300 is full of amazing shots, it is a feast of eye candy. And a lot can be analyzed and appreciated about the use of slow motion, the surreal comic book look, or the special effects that brought it all together. But during the 300 first battle, there is a moment that stands above the rest. The idea was to shoot a single-take fight but also include speed ramps and zooms in and out of the action. Trying to execute this ambitious shot in a “oner” would be extremely difficult, especially the timing and precision.

So, why is it called the “Crazy Horse Shot”? Zack Snyder thought he might be able to use a camera rig that was also used in a TV movie called Crazy Horse. That rig consisted of two cameras (one shooting B&W, the other shooting color) that could capture the same exact image at the same time. This was done with a beam splitter, a prism that split light into two directions.

But instead of two cameras, Snyder wanted three — each fitted with a different focal length lens. This way, they could capture three different shot sizes (wide, full, medium) at the same time. Then in post-production, they could time exactly when to zoom in and out between those shots. This technique is called a morph zoom (or nested zoom) because the transition between the shots had to be manufactured in editing.

However, after they shot this iconic 300 fight battle scene, there was an issue with the focus and it had to be re-done. The revised plan simply had 3 cameras positioned as closely together as possible instead of requiring a beam splitter. And thus, the Hot Gates Battle was complete and it easily became one of the most stunning shots in the movie and in recent years. The 300 first battle scene is the perfect example of when a creative vision requires technical innovation. Zack Snyder and his team gave us a fresh and thrilling way to shoot action, all without traditional editing.

Anton Chigurh became an instant icon in No Country for Old Men (2007). While some villains take years to earn their spot on the all-time greats list, Chigurh made the cut before the end credits rolled. But why? What makes him so compelling as an antagonist? In this Anton Chigurh character analysis, we’ll dissect everything we know about this character. And, as we’ll find out, his appeal is also tied to how he is used symbolically.

First, let’s talk about the character details we can observe about Anton Chigurh. His most curious feature is his haircut which is more befitting of a disco nightclub than of a psycho killer. But as the film’s hairstylist, Paul LeBlanc, points out, this was intentional. Chigurh’s clothes are a poor attempt at blending into this West Texas milieu. On top of that is his accent which is neutralized in Bardem’s performance. Together these aspects characterize Chigurh as clearly from another time and place. 

Anton Chigurh kills his victims with either a captive bolt stunner (typically used to slaughter cattle) and firearms equipped with silencers. He is also relentless in his pursuit of Llewelyn and the bag of money. Combined, they make him a heartless yet effective assassin.

Chigurh’s actions create even more ambiguity — there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason why he kills most anyone he encounters but lets others live, sometimes based on a coin toss. Despite his reputation as a killing machine, there is also some humanity that peeks through on rare occasions. In an early scene with the gas station proprietor, Chigurh chokes on a cashew, which is a quite vulnerable and “human” act.

But what really puts Anton Chigurh over the top as a character is how well he represents the theme of No Country for Old Men. In the book and the film, Sheriff Bell bemoans the state of the world — the rise in senseless violence and lack of morals has put Bell into an existential quandary. The source of this moral decay is ambiguous and dangerous, just like Chigurh himself. As co-writer and co-director Joel Coen mentions, Chigurh is meant to be a human character but also an idea. By presenting Anton Chigurh as an ambiguous and violent threat, he embodies everything Bell is afraid of and everything that No Country for Old Men is really about.

Here’s the lesson for writers: you can make your villain cruel, weird or scary but if you can also tie them directly to your story’s theme, that’s when great storytelling is born.

Visual storytelling is what cinematography is all about. But telling a story with moving images isn’t as easy as it seems. When it comes to storytelling with cinematography, the DP has a variety of tools and techniques to call upon. And in this video, we learn a lot about visual storytelling with cinematography techniques from one of the most versatile and unsung DPs, Newton Thomas Sigel. With a filmography that includes Drive (2011), X-Men (2000), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), Newton Thomas Sigel has made a career out of storytelling with cinematography.

First, let’s talk about camera lenses. In Cherry (2021), Sigel and the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo gave each of the film’s chapters its own distinct visual language. In the first chapter, when Cherry first meets and falls in love with Emily, they used TODD-AO and Petzval lenses to give the romance a swirling and softly out-of-focus beauty. But then, when Cherry goes into Basic Training, they switch to a 14mm wide-angle lens in order to give the images a surreal, farcical feeling.

Sigel also talks about aspect ratio as another tool in visual storytelling. In his film with Spike Lee, Da 5 Bloods (2020), they shot Ho Chi Minh City using a more modern, big city widescreen aspect ratio of 2.40:1. But then, once they enter the wilds of the Vietnamese jungle, the frame “opens up” to a taller 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Back to Cherry, during the Basic Training section, Sigel describes wanting to “box him in” to communicate just how trapped Cherry is. To visualize this, they went with a much boxier 1.66:1 frame.

The film medium itself can also be a big factor in the language of visual storytelling. For Three Kings (1999), two photochemical techniques were employed when developing the film. The first of these cinematography techniques is called a “skip bleach process,” where much of the silver is left on the negative. This creates higher contrast and more color saturation that Sigel used at the beginning of the film while the soldiers are insulated at the military base. The other technique is called “cross processing” in which the film is intentionally developed using the “wrong” chemicals. For example, processing color negative film as if it were color slide film, and vice versa. 

The language of visual storytelling in filmmaking is a language we all intuitively understand but few filmmakers can actually “speak.” Cinematographers like Newton Thomas Sigel have proven time and again that he is one such filmmaker.

The shootout scene is as old as cinema itself — from Thomas Edison filming Annie Oakley doing trick shots in 1894 to John Wick’s balletic shoot ‘em ups over a century later. And as film language evolved over the decades, so did the techniques used to present the shootout scene. In this video, we break down the various techniques of how to shoot a shootout scene using two polar opposite examples. 

Heat Shootout Scene — Directing Breakdown

The Heat shootout scene, directed by Michael Mann, is a fantastic example of how to direct a gunfight for pure realism. As a director, how does Mann make us feel like we are there on the street in the middle of the crossfire? First, staging the shootout scene on location in downtown Los Angeles helps the audience feel the reality of the situation. When you hear the sound design of the Heat shootout scene, it’s like nothing we’ve heard before. That’s because while most movies add the sound effects in post-production, what we’re hearing in this scene is all production sound. The camera is also another tool that Mann and his DP Dante Spinotti use to bring reality to the shootout scene. The camera mostly shoots from eye level and with long lenses that create a claustrophobic effect as the police surround McCauley and his men.

The Matrix Lobby Shootout Scene — Directing Breakdown

On the opposite side of the spectrum from the Heat shootout scene is The Matrix lobby shootout. Instead of 1:1 realism, The Matrix shootout scene, directed by Lilly and Lana Wachowski, goes big and bold for a stylized presentation. Most obvious is the mixing of frame rates, including the now-iconic slow motion. The sound design, too, is more expressive — specifically, the reverbed pinging of empty bullet casings on the ground. There is also a fluidity to the shootout scene in the form of cutting on action, eye trace, and a controlled camera that allows the spectacle to unfold in front of it.

Most filmmakers present the shootout scene somewhere in between these two extremes. No matter the formal techniques used, a great shootout scene can be thrilling and beautiful.

Linus Sandgren is a cinematographer on the rise. From more character-driven projects like American Hustle and Joy to spectacles like La La Land and First Man — his range is off the charts. In this video, we look to one of his latest projects, No Time to Die, and how they pulled off an incredible chase through Matera. Along with director Cary Joji Fukunaga, Sandgren explains the location, stunts, and using IMAX cameras to capture the thrilling No Time to Die car chase.

First is the location. Sandgren describes the qualities that make Matera such an ideal location for this “romantic action,” to use his words. Not only do we get the picturesque beauty of Italy, we also get the brutal and unforgiving stone streets and buildings. Together, these juxtaposed elements were ideal for Bond’s chase through Matera.

The next important element in the No Time to Die car chase is the stunt work. Linus Sandgren describes the goal to find a balance between a spectacular James Bond car chase while sticking to possible (not impossible) stunts. 

And finally, to capture the beauty and spectacle, Sandgren explains the decision to shoot both with an anamorphic format as well as IMAX. The benefits are the widest and tallest aspect ratios that would present the action in such a way that submerges the audience. They even strapped IMAX cameras to motorcycles!

All in all, the No Time to Die car chase through Matera will go down as one of the best crafted and most tense James Bond sequences. Thanks to DP Linus Sandgren and director Cary Joji Fukunaga, Daniel Craig’s last go-round as James Bond is just as satisfying and spectacular as his first.

Dune Sound Design Explained

If you’ve seen Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic, you know that the Dune sound design is a force to be reckoned with. From the organic buzzing of the Ornithopter to the digital clicking of the combat shields to the commanding voice of Bene Gesserit — there is so much power in the Dune sound design. In this video essay, we’ll let Denis Villeneuve and his sound team walk us through the creative and technical challenges of bringing a galaxy to life with sound.

The Voice

In Dune the voice of the Bene Gesserit cannot be ignored by those who hear it. To capture such inescapable control, the team explains the layering and low, rumbling frequencies. As we will undoubtedly see in Dune Part 2, when Paul uses the voice, people will listen.

Ornithopter Sound Design

Then there is the dragonfly-inspired Ornithopter with its multiple wings flapping and thrumming like a motorized hummingbird. To generate a more organic ornithopter sound design, they used a combination of cats purring and canvas straps flapping in the wind. By grounding the sound design with familiar and natural sources, an alien world like Arrakis suddenly feels more real.

Dune Shield Combat

Where the Dune sound design really shines is in how it embodies completely fictional elements such as the combat shields. The sound team explains how when generating the synth sound for the shields, a glitch in the program caused those clicks and pops that we hear in the film. They decided to keep those imperfections because they so naturally suggested the vulnerability of the shields themselves. 

Perspective

One area of sound design and mixing that we often take for granted is perspective. In other words, the relationship between the qualities of the sounds we hear in relation to the proximity of the camera. If we’re close to a character like the Baron, we can hear his deep, raspy voice echoing through his body.

Dune Sound Design Tips

And finally, the Dune sound design team discusses some of the sound design tips that are necessary when mixing for laptops and phones. These lessons in how to sound design are what make such inventive and immersive high-budget filmmaking so thrilling to watch. Denis Villeneuve and his sound design team show us the possibilities of creating an entire universe from the ground up, one sound at a time.

Film editing is a language that started with the simple cut over a century ago. Since then, film and video editing techniques have turned that language into poetry. In this episode of The Shot List, we’re looking at the major film editing and video editing techniques that can be used when editing a scene. These techniques include eyeline match, cross cutting, eye trace, split edits, intellectual montage, and cut on action. We’ll explain how to edit video using these techniques and what they bring to the storytelling process.

First up is the eyeline match — where a character’s eyes guide the edit. If we see a character notice something off-screen, our immediate response is “What are they looking at?” Most of the time, the editor complies and cuts to match the character’s eyeline (not only what they see but from their literal or general perspective).

In film editing, cross cutting (or intercutting) is essentially weaving two or more scenes into one. The classic example of cross cutting is the baptism scene in The Godfather as we watch Michael become “The Godfather” twice over — to his sister’s child and to the Corleone family as we watch his men assassinate his rivals.

One bit of film theory from legendary editor Walter Murch is called eye trace. To help the viewer along, eye trace suggests to cut between shots when the area of focus is in the same spot. That way, the viewer can stay focused on the moment, especially when rapidly cutting through action scenes.

A hard cut is when both the sound and image are switch simultaneously to the next shot. But a split edit allows for the sound or image to switch before the other. These are known as either the J cut or the L cut — based on the way they look in a film editing timeline. These techniques are useful in dialogue scenes to help pace out the conversation and allow for reaction shots.

Intellectual montage is a fascinating bit of editing theory that suggests that when presented with two images back-to-back, the viewer will search for a connection between them. When deployed strategically, filmmakers can create meaning through juxtaposition that wouldn’t otherwise be there. 

And, finally, much of movie editing is built around the cut on action — when a cut is made within a character or object’s movement in the frame. Rather than creating a chaotic onslaught of fragmented punches and kicks, the cut on action creates a more seamless flow.

These are the essential film editing and video editing techniques that editors use all the time. And as soon as you master these video editing tips and tricks, you’ll be able to speak that language fluently.

Movie opening scenes have a big responsibility to set the tone, establish characters, and essentially convince the audience to go along for the ride. In the previous episodes of this mini-series on the opening scene, we covered techniques like introducing the villain or employing a flashforward. In Art of the Opening Scene Pt. 3, we’ll tackle six more opening scene techniques.

One way to begin a movie is to use a newsreel, or newscast, to present the audience with pure exposition. This is an opening scene technique designed to deliver as much information as possible, especially when dealing with a high-concept premise like Children of Men. In this opening scene, we hear two bits of critical information, setting us up for how they will inform the plot.

The next opening scene technique starts with “the crime.” Often a murder, this event is what kickstarts the plot and turns the audience into witnesses. For Zodiac, David Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt go to great lengths to recreate one of Zodiac’s first killings. This thrusts us into the story and we understand firsthand what Graysmith and the detectives are up against.

You can also begin a movie with a tragedy. Usually, we see this in the death of a family member but no matter the event, the emotional impact will follow the character through the main plot. In Arrival, we see Louise lose her daughter to illness, so when she later encounters the aliens and starts having flashbacks, we start connecting the dots.

The first scene in a script can also establish the setting of the film, which often functions as a character of its own. Think of the ghostly tour of the Nostromo in Ridley Scott’s Alien or how we see the juxtaposition of two worlds (space and Earth) in WALL-E. This is a particularly effective option to begin a movie when the setting is much more than just a location.

You can also opt for opening sequences that follow a “day in the life” of the main character. Perfect for character-driven stories, especially those in which their routine is disrupted by the subsequent plot. For example, in Stranger Than Fiction, we get a precise, mathematical breakdown of Harold’s routine which sets a baseline for all the chaos that gets thrown at him later.

The final technique for an opening scene is direct address, otherwise known as breaking the fourth wall. Having a character speak directly to us collapses the distance between the world of the film and the world of the audience. Suddenly, we are part of the story and the hope is that our engagement is connected instantly.

These are just six options for opening scenes to movies that fit the story they’re trying to tell. With these options under your belt, you’ll be able to begin a movie with the perfect opening scene.

What is a leitmotif in film music? Well, if you survey the filmography of composer John Williams, you’ll find countless leitmotifs and some of the greatest film music ever. Jaws, Jurassic Park, Superman, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind — movies that have iconic scores thanks to the use of the leitmotif. In this video, we’ll review the work of composers like Williams, Howard Shore, and Michael Giacchino who use the leitmotif in four distinct ways.

The leitmotif has its origins in opera and became most well-known in the work of Richard Wagner. Wagner built leitmotifs into his work to signify characters, locations, emotions and even ideas. In a way, the leitmotif is a shorthand for the audience, a way to directly associate music in storytelling. Naturally, film composers have embraced this same technique to enrich how stories can be told with sound just as much as images.

The first type of film music leitmotif is used to signify characters. In Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, composer John Williams relies heavily on the unforgettable shark leitmotif. In this case, the music stands in for the shark itself since we see very little of the monster until the end. And if you think a film music leitmotif needs to be complicated to work, remember that the Jaws theme is built on just two notes.

The second type of film music leitmotif is used to invoke setting. In The Lord of the Rings, composer Howard Shore imbues nearly all of the major locations of Middle Earth with it’s own musical leitmotif. From the light and lilting motif of The Shire to the foreboding horns of Mordor. In science fiction and fantasy films, these musical leitmotifs help situate the audience in unfamiliar worlds.

The third type of film music leitmotif is used to express an emotion. In Pixar’s Up, we have a rather heartbreaking use of the leitmotif. We run through Carl and Ellie’s life in an early montage with a motif that is first light and playful when they’re in love and then mournful when tragedy strikes.

The final type of film music leitmotif is used to follow the evolution of a character. Play the “Imperial March” and most people will immediately think of Darth Vader. When we first hear in the Star Wars films, this leitmotif suggests the evil power of Lord Vader. But, in The Phantom Menace, when we meet him as an innocent boy named Anakin, John Williams adds the faintest touch of the leitmotif to foreshadow his eventual transformation from the light to the dark side. And at the end of Return of the Jedi, as Vader lays dying, we hear a slow and final iteration of the leitmotif.

Color temperature and white balance are elements that every photographer and cinematographer must understand. Every shot needs to be lit and every light has a color temperature. So, whether you want realism or something abstract in the colors of your image, a firm grasp of color temperature and white balance is absolutely necessary. In this video, we’re going to explain the science and creative choices behind these concepts so that you can master the lighting and color temperature in any scenario.

So, what is color temperature? Skipping over the extremely difficult math and science, color temperature is the color given off by a particular light source. For example, a candle is yellow/orange while a clear sky is bright blue. These color temperatures can be identified on a scale or spectrum, measured in Kelvin (not Celsius or Fahrenheit used for measuring actual temperatures). 

But knowing the color temperature fundamentals doesn’t stop there, that’s just one half of the puzzle. The other consideration is the white balance setting of your camera. So, what is white balance? White balance is a setting that adjusts how colors are registered. Most cameras have preset white balance settings to choose from so that if you’re shooting outside on a “daylight” white balance preset, the colors will register the same in-camera as they appear to your eyes. 

So, in most shooting scenarios, you’d want to capture those accurate or true colors. But there might also be a situation when you want to boost the orange or blue colors beyond their actual color temperature. This is most commonly achieved by either adjusting the color temperature of the light source, like with a gel, or by adjusting the white balance camera setting.

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to color temperature and white balance. They are simply another set of tools image makers use to dial in their perfect shot. And once you understand the rules, you’ll know how to break them.

The training montage was certainly “a thing” in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Ignited by the Rocky training montage, these sequences became a dime a dozen, so much so that these days they exist mostly as parodies. But that’s not to say that there isn’t still an opportunity to use the training montage in unique and powerful ways. In this video, we’re going to look at two scenes in particular: the Creed 2 training scene and “The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei” sequence from Kill Bill Vol. 2. 

There are three elements that you can always count on in a training montage — the use of repetition to show progress, an inspirational soundtrack, and a triumphant conclusion. Just like the traditional montage, a training montage is designed to accelerate the storytelling in a short amount of time. We obviously don’t have time to watch characters study for a test, or master a particular skill, or train for the big fight. And, so, repetition is a technique that gives us the impression of time and progress. To bring real momentum to the training montage, filmmakers use some adrenaline-pumping music with motivational lyrics to help push the hero through their training. And, finally, the capper that brings the sequence to a close is the triumphant conclusion: that moment when the hero is now ready to face the challenge ahead.

One variation of the typical training scene is the “Master and Apprentice” training montage. Think of Yoda training Luke, or Mr. Miyagi training Daniel — not only do we follow a hero’s transformation, we also often see an evolution in the relationship between master and apprentice. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, we get a quick training montage as Beatrix is trained by the legendary Pai Mei. Director Quentin Tarantino uses crash zooms to make Pai Mei as intimidating as possible, along with high and low angles to show his power over his apprentice. But as the Pai Mei training montage continues with repetition and more eye level camera angles, we see Pai Mei finally accept his apprentice.

In the Creed 2 training scene, we have an example of a “Hero and Villain” training montage. This is when we see both protagonist and the antagonist training simultaneously. As Adonis Creed toils away in the desert in a grueling training regimen, we also see Viktor Drago pushing himself just as hard in a top of the line training facility. For even more contrast, we see two distinct color palettes — orange for the Adonis scenes and blue for Viktor. The parallel editing between these two sequences allows the viewer to assess the progress of both challengers as they head into the climactic battle. 

There are certain aspects one expects from a training montage but there are also ways to keep them fresh and exhilarating. We can see that creativity in sequences like the Creed 2 training scene and the Kill Bill training montage.

Film composition, or composition in film, is a rather complicated concept when you realize just how much is involved. As Roger Deakins explains in this episode of Cinematography Techniques, blocking & staging, lighting, lenses, framing and more are all part and parcel of cinematic composition. 

First, Deakins explains the unique challenge he and director Sam Mendes set before themselves in 1917. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot means that rules around composition, blocking & staging, and standard coverage required creative problem-solving. For example, in an early bunker scene, the entire blocking and staging of the actors and camera had to be reworked to ensure that the camera was always focused on the most important subject(s) at any given time. And, so, a second table was brought in and the choreography was adjusted to maintain their “single-shot goal” while keeping the framing and composition active and meaningful. 

In a film like Kundun, Deakins explains how director Martin Scorsese wanted symmetrical, proscenium framing to support the film’s themes around Buddhism and the power held by the boy leader. Whereas this formal elegance would be antithetical to the grounded and chaotic world of war in Jarhead. Here, handheld cameras help create a purposefully inconsistent cinematic composition.

Film composition follows similar standards as photography composition and this is where Roger Deakins first learned about them. By studying the location, the lighting, deciding on a lens, where you place the camera, all of these decisions combine when deciding on composition.

Heroes are easy but knowing how to write a great villain takes special consideration. While some villains can just exist as pure evil, many villain archetypes require more dimension. This video essay is all about writing good villains but it is by no means comprehensive nor the only way to do so. Villain writing is a complex and nuanced topic — here, we’re just scratching the surface. So, let’s talk about how to write a bad guy using examples from Christopher Nolan & The Dark Knight, Andrew Kevin Walker & Se7en, and Paul Thomas Anderson & There Will Be Blood.

First up, “the Mirror Villain,” that dastardly antagonist who is almost a reflection of our hero. These types of villains exhibit similar traits, goals, or perspectives as the hero but often diverge on the necessary means. For our example, we look into how Jonathan and Christopher Nolan write a great villain like The Joker. Batman and The Joker are both outsiders, to the people of Gotham but even to their respective sides of the law. They share the same goal of how to shape life in Gotham but their methods couldn’t be more different.

Now, let’s look at Andrew Kevin Walker’s script for Se7en and the “Looming Threat Villain.” Sometimes, the threat posed to the protagonist(s) is basically absent from the story but that doesn’t make them any less effective or powerful. In Se7en, other than two brief glimpses, we don’t actually meet John Doe until the final act. And yet, we’ve seen what he is capable of and we know from eyewitness accounts that this is a psychopath of the highest order. Therein lies the key of how to write a villain like John Doe — keep them absent but make sure we know what we’re up against.

Finally, we have “The Villain Protagonist” who would be the antagonist in any other story. Think of Alex in A Clockwork Orange or Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. For our example of how to write a villain protagonist, we look to Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood. The key to writing villains like Daniel Plainview is to balance their villainy with a little bit of sympathy. We have to care just enough to be invested in this character’s plight…but they should also be evil enough to remind us that they are still the villain.

No matter which of the villain archetypes fit your story best, each has its own unique attributes that make them the perfect villain. As they say, a story’s only as good as its villain.

Jump cut editing has been a part of film language from the very beginning. Though its invention is believed to be a happy accident, the intentional use of jump cuts has evolved for a variety of purposes. In this jump cut tutorial, we’ll cover 5 different applications of this editing technique — not just how to jump cut, which is very simple, but also when to use jump cuts to tell a better story.

The first jump cut example is to simply create a stylish presentation. Think of the opening character introductions in Guy Ritchie’s Snatch and how the jump cuts create a rhythm and style that lures us into this darkly comedic yet dangerous criminal underworld. We can also look at Terrence Malick’s films like The Tree of Life, a film presented as more of a memory and/or dream. In this case, we can see how to use jump cuts to create a lyrical or poetic narrative that isn’t beholden to strict and rigid structures.

The second jump cut example is used to create energy. Consider Run, Lola, Run and how our main character’s frantic race against time is accelerated by jump cuts. Or what about Mad Max: Fury Road where the action is adrenalized by cutting out nearly imperceptible frames.

Closely related to this jump cut technique is when they are used to accent a particular mental state or emotion. Usually, this is a frenetic or fragmented frame of mind, which is a perfect opportunity for some creative jump cut tricks. Think of the moment in The Departed when Billy realizes his cover may have been blown. He packs his go-bag in a fit of panic and with some extremely subtle jump cuts, we can better understand his urgency.

The montage is also an opportunity to use jump cuts. As one of the primary benefits of the montage is to condense time and what better way to do that than with a jump cut? In Spielberg’s bleak Holocaust drama Schindler’s List, we have a short montage constructed solely with jump cuts. As Oskar interviews new secretaries, we use jump cut editing, along with blocking and staging, to tell the whole story.

Finally, in our last jump cut example, we have the axial cut. An axial cut is more of a subtype of the jump cut as it doesn’t jump forward in time but rather towards or away from the subject along the same axis. Alfred Hitchcock used this technique often including the first moment of pure panic in Psycho as Marion is attacked in the shower. 

How to jump cut is easy but knowing when to use jump cuts is the real question. It is a jarring technique that could easily pull your audience out of the movie. So, as you work in jump cuts into your next project remember these techniques and applications.

The Shining (1980) is without question an amazing and terrifying film by director Stanley Kubrick. Even decades later, we find ourselves searching for answers to what The Shining is truly about. Particularly in the last few years, a number of compelling interpretations have emerged: The Wendy Theory, The Shining Moon Landing Theory, the 1919 World Series allegory, etc. But our analysts have spent months poring over each frame of the film...and even we couldn’t believe what we found — The Shining is actually a Christmas movie?! No, really.

Let’s start with the obvious symbolism: red and green. Look at the red bathroom scene with Charles Grady, redrum, and, of course, the geyser of blood pouring out of the elevator. For green, we’ve got Jack’s wardrobe, the green bathroom in Room 237, and, of course, the hedge maze. But that’s just the beginning of our The Shining theory.

Perhaps the most strict criteria for a Christmas movie is that it must take place during Christmas. So, what day did Christmas fall on in 1980 when The Shining was released? No need to look it up — it was a Thursday. And what two days occupy more than half of the entire movie? Wednesday and Thursday — Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 1980.

If Stanley Kubrick wasn’t making a Christmas movie with The Shining, then why did he give us such clear clues to suggest it? Like the Holly brand bag of salt Jack sleeps on in the pantry. Or when the Torrance family is driving up to The Overlook Hotel, why are they talking about “the Donner party” — if you think this is just a reference to another mountainous tragedy as clever foreshadowing, you’re not paying attention. Donner is one of Santa’s reindeer! 

What about the drink that Grady spills on Jack at the party, Advocaat. This is a Dutch beverage made with basically the same ingredients as egg nog, except it uses brandy instead of rum. Or is it redrum?! Are we forgetting the twelve turkeys that Halloran points out to Wendy and Danny in the freezer? Twelve is a significant number in both The Shining and Christmas. There’s the 12 Days of Christmas and the ever-so-slight coincidence that Room 237 adds up to 12 (2 + 3 + 7)!

Once you see The Shining explained as a Christmas movie, how you see Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece and the yuletide holiday will be changed forever...and ever...and ever.

Irony is just as inseparable from storytelling as it is from life. We see it in our everyday lives but irony is also one of the most misunderstood concepts. That is the goal of this video: to define irony and all its forms so that writers and storytellers can wield it with clarity and precision. So, what is irony? What are the different types of irony and how can they be used across any genre for a multitude of purposes? Let’s get started.

We define irony as when reality is the opposite of expectation or when what is said is the opposite of the intended meaning. Perhaps the biggest misconception about irony is that any lucky or strange or coincidental situation qualifies as ironic. The key thing to remember when thinking of irony is the word “opposite” — if it’s not opposite, it’s not irony. Everything else is bad luck, odd coincidence, or an unexpected surprise. We just defined pure irony but there are many variations we need to discuss.

There are three main types of irony: verbal irony, situational irony, and dramatic irony. And within those main branches, we have sarcasm, understatement, overstatement, Socratic irony, cosmic irony, poetic irony, structural irony, historical irony, and tragic irony. Phew! 

Verbal irony covers speech — what we say is the opposite of what we mean. This isn’t the same as lying or being hypocritical, this is an intentionally worded phrase that is meant to be understood as ironic. Sarcasm is when you use verbal irony to criticize or ridicule someone else. Overstatement is using exaggeration to express a thought or feeling and understatement goes the opposite direction to de-emphasize the intended meaning. Socratic irony is used when someone “feigns ignorance” (aka “plays dumb”) to outsmart someone else.

Situational irony is when the opposite of what we expect to happen, happens. Cosmic irony adds a layer of “fate” or “divine influence” to traditional situational irony. Poetic irony occurs when goodness is rewarded and evil is punished in a particularly ironic way. Structural irony is when an entire character and/or story is based on an ironic situation. And historical irony is when hindsight provides an ironic twist on past events.

Dramatic irony also involves a sharp contrast between expectation and reality but, in this case, the audience or reader understands the truth before the characters do. This can create tension and suspense as we wait to see what happens when the characters finally encounter the truth. Tragic irony is simply dramatic irony with tragic consequences — think of Shakespeare’s tragedies like Othello and Romeo and Juliet.
When writers understand the depths and nuances of irony, they can tackle any subject or genre with this exceptionally effective tool.

In film editing, transitions between scenes are sometimes overlooked opportunities to help tell your story. While most scene transitions use only a simple cut, there are many more creative and cinematic transitions filmmakers can use. In this video, we’ll review the various video transitions and film transitions, their particular qualities, and what they add to visual storytelling. 

One of the most common film transitions is the fade in and fade out. Typically, these are used to open and close a film but they can also be used in between scenes to create a more definitive separation. Besides the cut, one of the most frequently used transitions is the dissolve (or cross dissolve). This is when one scene gradually fades out while the next scene gradually fades in. The dissolve is just one of the techniques used to create seamless transitions but also to suggest a passing of time or to switch to a flashback or dream.

The match cut is a film transition purely meant to create a connection between one shot to the next or one scene to the next. That connection can be made with shapes, colors, movement, or even sound. The match cut is an instant scene transition but a match dissolve accomplishes both the “connection” of a match cut with the “smoothness” of a cross dissolve. The iris transition is an old-fashioned technique that is rarely used unless you’re going for a nostalgic or retro style.

Similarly, the wipe transition is a bit archaic in terms of film and video transitions. George Lucas built the wipe transition into the visual language of Star Wars as a nod to his two biggest inspirations for the Skywalker Saga — the Flash Gordon serials and Kurosawa’s Hidden Fortress. A modern approach to these same cinematic transitions is called a passing transition (or pass-by effect). This involves using movement in the frame to wipe seamlessly into the next scene and it’s one of director Edgar Wright’s favorite film editing transitions.

Next, there’s the whip pan, when the camera pans quickly to create a blurry image (where a cut can be hidden) leading into another whip pan to start the next scene. These types of film transitions not only create smooth transitions, they help sustain the momentum from one scene to the next. A smash cut is perhaps the most abrupt film transition because it is built on contrast between loud and quiet, or active and still, or sometimes both. 

Finally, there’s the J cut and L cut, two ways to use a split between audio and video for a variety of effects. For example, an L cut is often used when a character begins narrating a flashback. And a J cut is commonly used to build anticipation for the following scene. These are just the most common video transitions and new transition effects are created all the time. Your job as filmmakers is to find the right scene transitions that help tell your story.

In this Dune breakdown, we brought together clips of director Denis Villeneuve, cinematographer Greig Fraser, editor Joe Walker, and composer Hans Zimmer discussing their work on the latest adaptation of Frank Herbert’s Dune. If you’ve seen Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, you know there’s a lot to look at, listen to, and appreciate about the filmmaking craft on display. So sit back and enjoy the making of Dune.

The first thing we learn is that Dune has been on Denis Villeneuve’s mind for decades, ever since he was a teenager. In fact, it’s no exaggeration to say that Dune was a dream come true for the filmmaker. Villeneuve explains his process of adapting the book and highlighting the female characters in the story.

Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser talks about the cameras and lenses used to capture insanely wide shots and intimately composed close-ups. Editor Joe Walker also mentions the imagery of Villeneuve’s Dune and how much “sensory” information we get to help ground us in another world. For composer Hans Zimmer, Dune was also a passion project that he was honored to be a part of. 
Again, to emphasize the female power and presence in this story, Zimmer explains how the female voice became so integral in crafting the Dune soundtrack. 

And, finally, we look at the film’s production design. Villeneuve explains this unique approach to the sci-fi genre because it looks and feels more like a period piece than a science fiction epic. Part of this was due to the lack of computers in Frank Herbert’s vision of the future but Villeneuve also explains how this “ancient-future” helps create a direct recognition for the audience.

Anamorphic lenses have been used for decades, giving birth to widescreen cinema and that coveted “cinematic look.” In this video, we will break down the various visual and practical characteristics of anamorphic lenses and how they compare to the standard spherical lenses. So, what is an anamorphic lens and why are filmmakers constantly searching for that “anamorphic look”? Before we can answer that question, we need to answer another question — what are spherical lenses?

Camera and projector lenses were almost always spherical lenses, meaning the shape of the glass elements are constructed in a circular fashion. In the ‘50s, when TV was draining the cinema-going audience away from theaters, the studio heads tried everything they could to bring that audience back.

One tactic that stuck (and changed cinema forever) was using anamorphic lenses to give audiences something they couldn’t get at home — widescreen images. Anamorphic lenses have more oval-shaped elements that bend and squeeze rectangular images onto the same square film. Another anamorphic lens is required to “unsqueeze” that image when projected in a theater. But producing a widescreen image was just the beginning of why filmmakers preferred anamorphic vs spherical lenses.

For example, anamorphic lens flare is more pronounced than with a spherical lens. You can get a more shallow depth of field with anamorphic vs spherical and you also get greater “falloff” — when the focus gets softer towards the edges of the frame. Vignetting is another bi-product when using anamorphic lenses. These visual considerations tend to produce what people consider a more “cinematic look.” Spherical lenses are sharper and cleaner but sometimes a softer and more subjective feel best suits the story you want to tell. 

As you approach your next project, think about the pros and cons of anamorphic vs spherical lenses. Each has their benefits and they should be used like any other tool in the filmmaking process — what story do you want to tell and what tools do you need to tell it?

The Mexican Standoff is a staple of the action and crime genres. But what is a Mexican Standoff and how is it different from a traditional standoff? In this video, we’ll explain the key difference between these two commonly confused situations. For our study, we examined Mexicans Standoffs from directors known for tense and deadly scenes — Quentin Tarantino, John Woo, and Taylor Sheridan. Our goal is to highlight the filmmaking techniques anyone can use to craft similarly effective Mexican standoffs.

So, what is a Mexican Standoff according to Quentin Tarantino? Many of the films he either simply wrote (like True Romance and Natural Born Killers) as well as those he’s directed (like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Inglourious Basterds) have excellent examples. But for our purposes, we’ll look at one of the first: the Reservoir Dogs Mexican Standoff. Overall, Tarantino’s presentation can perhaps best be described as “objective and neutral.” In other words, the techniques he employed such as a static camera, deep focus, and a lack of music help create a situation for the audience in which we passive observers to the inevitable carnage. 

This is the opposite approach John Woo took in the Face/Off Mexican Standoff. Here, Woo opts for more cinematic and hyper-stylized techniques. To match the film’s over-the-top premise, Woo uses slow motion, a variety of shot sizes, a dramatic score, and dynamic camera movement. The end result is a stylish, tense, and dramatic showdown.

Finally, the Wind River Mexican Standoff from writer/director Taylor Sheridan finds a middle ground between Tarantino and Woo. The presentation here is much more subjective and disorienting — that puts the audience directly into the chaos. He does this with a handheld camera, crossing the 180-degree line many times, and wardrobe for the characters that make it difficult to tell who is who. By doing so, we are not afforded the neutral distance like the Reservoir Dogs Mexican Standoff nor the detached stylization of the Face/Off Mexican Standoff. 

These are just three (of many) ways to approach directing the Mexican Standoff.

─────────────────────

The opening scene can make or break a movie. That makes knowing how to begin a movie extremely important for screenwriters. In the last episode of this mini-series on opening sequences, we covered six types of opening scenes. This time, we’re covering six more, including the dream sequence, red herring, flash forward, in medias res, flashback, and bookend.

The flashback scene is a great way to begin a movie. The best opening scenes that begin in the past isolate a formative moment for the protagonist or antagonist. These scenes highlight what motivates them or haunts them throughout their character development. Instead of starting in the past, flash forward scenes throw us into the future. This is a moment in the story, either from the middle or even the very end, that sparks the question: how will we get there?

Similar to the flash forward opening scene is in medias res. For in medias res movies, we also begin in what seems to be the middle of the story. Often, these opening scenes skip over what would have been the first act and inciting incident in a traditional story. Unlike the flash forward, though, in medias res openings do very little (or nothing at all) to fill in what we missed. They simply start in the middle and keep going from there. The dream sequence opening scene is fairly self-explanatory — but WHAT you decide to use them for varies greatly. Most of the time, the dream sequence opening scene is used to pinpoint some deep and active psychological concern for the protagonist. It shows us what they are working on internally, which may or may not have direct bearing on the plot thereafter.

The bookend is an example of how to open a movie with imagery, scenes, or ideas that also close out the film. This creates a “circular” narrative that either illuminates how much or how little a character has changed. Finally, the red herring opening scene is an excellent way to begin a movie. This is especially important when dealing with movies that employ a surprise ending. By immediately planting a false clue, the audience will be less likely to assume there is any sort of deception. That way, when the truth is finally revealed, they will be even more shocked.

How to begin a movie is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions. However, by knowing your options for opening sequences and how they work, you’ll be able to better choose the best first scene.

─────────────────────

Almost every horror movie has a jump scare (or two...or twelve). In fact, for many people, the overuse of jump scares has turned them into a cliche of the genre. In other words, we’ve all seen our fair share of horror movie jump scares so what makes a great jump scare and why do some fall flat? In this video, we’re going to run through four different techniques filmmakers can use to create the next great jump scare.

The first technique necessary for a jump scare is timing and there are two general categories to consider: shock and suspense. Shock is created with a sudden and unexpected event; suspense, on the other hand, is created with a delayed and expected event. Therefore, by definition, a shocking jump scare has no build-up — the timing just comes down to when to spring the surprise. A suspenseful jump scare requires some anticipation, which typically lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to nearly 5 minutes.

The next technique in making a scary jumpscare is to withhold information. In most of these scenes, suspicions are raised — something is going to happen but we don’t know what, where, or when. The more successful a filmmaker is at generating these compelling questions, the greater the jump scare (in theory). So, how do we withhold information? By limiting what we can see and hear. Shadows are the perfect place to hide our biggest fears. Looking through keyholes or even using a found footage style of shooting where the shaky camera makes it even more difficult to see what we need to see.

Third, and perhaps most important in building good jump scares, is the sting. The sting is that typically loud noise that accompanies the jump. This can be any diegetic sound like someone screaming, a chainsaw ripping to life, or a cat screeching. Or it could be a non-diegetic sound like a sharp, jarring hit in the musical score. Some of the most creative jump scares use the lack of a sting and opt for a whisper, someone speaking, or no sound at all.

Finally, a great jump scare will often use some form of misdirection to help surprise the audience. This usually centers on the location of where the jump scare happens. If you think the monster is in the closet, when it appears under the bed instead, the fright could be elevated. Another form of misdirection in jump scares is the fake-out. For example, when the closet door is finally opened but it’s empty. Then, almost immediately after that, the real threat appears from behind.

Jump scares are a dime a dozen but a great jump scare will have people talking for years. Hopefully, these tips and techniques will help you make one of the best jump scares ever in your next project.

Expectation vs reality — before this trend caught fire on YouTube, it was the emotional peak of the film 500 Days of Summer. The premise is simple and universal. We ALL have expectations for our careers, romantic relationships, etc. But what the 500 Days of Summer Expectations vs Reality scene reminds us of is that reality is almost always different. 

In this video essay, we’re going to examine this scene from a film directing perspective. The Expectations vs Reality scene gives us a rare opportunity to see how to shoot two different scenes at the same time. In particular, how tiny details like background extras, set dressing, lens choice, and camera framing can all add up to shift the mood and meaning of a scene.

As Tom arrives at Summer’s apartment for the party, he expects a warm embrace and a quick kiss but in reality, he gets a cordial and platonic hug. Immediately from these two actions, the difference between expectation vs reality is clear but what decisions did director Marc Webb make to accent and amplify the body language and performances? A soft focus close-up on Summer as she beams when Tom arrives (expectation) versus a neutral medium two-shot as they hug with little romance (reality).

Tom also expects only a few party guests, which would allow Summer’s attention to be undivided on him. In reality, the apartment is full of people and Tom’s hopes of a quiet, romantic evening fall flat. If we saw either scene in isolation, we might not register the amount of extras in the background. But by showing these moments side-by-side, it’s easy to see how an otherwise purely logistical consideration like how many extras to place in the scene suddenly becomes part of the overall storytelling.

Tom expects an intimate dinner setting with wine, candles, and an enthralling and personal conversation with Summer. In reality, Tom and Summer share an awkward and impersonal interaction with strangers and none of those romantic accoutrements. Here we can see again how a simple choice to either place the lovers together in the center of the frame versus splitting them up on opposite sides is a direct way to communicate connection or disconnection.

Marc Webb’s 500 Days of Summer hinges on this idea of Expectation vs Reality. Tom struggles with reality because he is so entrenched in expectations. And so to construct the 500 Days of Summer Expectations vs Reality scene at Tom’s ultimate heartbreak moment is a stroke of genius. And for filmmakers, we get the perfect lesson in how the little details really shape the mood and meaning of a scene.

Rodrigo Prieto is a DP (director of photography) you may have heard of, but chances are slim you’d be able to pin down his signature style. That’s because he is a cinematic chameleon, a master of versatility who can adapt to any director, genre, or style. In this Rodrigo Prieto interview collection, we let the man himself talk us through various topics including subjective cinematography, working with visionaries like Scorsese and Iñárritu, Ang Lee, and other iconic directors he pulls his inspiration from.

Subjective cinematography is nothing new and Rodrigo Prieto isn’t the first or last to embrace it. That being said, Prieto has seemingly perfected this type of subjectivity in the lenses he uses, the shots he chooses, and even the type of film stock. For example, he explains the choice to film with anamorphic lenses in Babel to create a shallow depth of field to visually communicate the isolation of a deaf character from the world around her.

In The Irishman cinematography, Rodrigo Prieto chose different film stocks for the different decades of the story. Specifically, Kodachrome for the ‘50s, Ektachrome for the ‘60s, and ENR for the ‘70s — all purposefully chosen to give the images the look and feel of those particular eras. In Argo, the three worlds of the film (Iran, Hollywood, CIA) were shot with different stocks, lenses, and stabilizers to give them each a distinct personality. And for the sci-fi film Passengers, the decision to shoot digital was motivated to create a pristine and futuristic image.

Prieto also discusses how his main source of inspiration comes from still photography. As part of his preparation for each project, he puts together a “lookbook” of images to help guide that project’s vision. For Silence, it was a combination of Baroque style of painting and Byōbu (Japanese screen art). For 8 Mile, it was a mural by Diego Rivera depicting industrial work in Detroit with its heavy green and orange hues that inspired that film’s lighting.

Whether it's his approach to subjective cinematography or his versatility when it comes to format, gear, lenses, and styles, Rodrigo Prieto is a director of photography worth keeping an eye on. Prieto reminds us just how important the cinematographer is to visual storytelling. To date, he’s been nominated for three Best Cinematography Oscars (Brokeback Mountain, Silence, The Irishman) but it’s only a matter of time before he nabs his first statue.

You talking to me? It’s a question that immediately brings to mind the Taxi Driver scene in which we witness deranged vigilante Travis Bickle’s tipping point. The “You talking to me?” quote quickly became ripe for parody, a popular go-to for a wise-cracking impression. But the context of the scene is actually quite dark and disturbing — a mood director Martin Scorsese navigates expertly. In this Taxi Driver scene breakdown, we’ll look at all the elements surrounding Robert De Niro’s iconic improv monologue that make this such a haunting moment.

Perhaps the most interesting part of this scene is how we switch between an objective perspective of Travis Bickle to a more subjective glimpse inside his mind. In the first half of the scene, Scorsese makes us objective observers as if we were there in the room. He does this with a static camera, long takes, and diegetic audio that captures the ambient noise of the neighbors and the street outside. In the second half of the scene, we lose that diegetic audio and replace it with voiceover narration and Bernard Herrmann’s dark and moody score. The camera remains static but the editing kicks in to bend and twist reality — dissolving in between shots instead of cutting and a “double-edit” that replays the same moment twice. 

With these opposing techniques, Martin Scorsese gave us two perspectives on Travis Bickle during his tipping point. Are we more uncomfortable with being in the same room with Travis or is it worse to occupy his headspace? No matter the answer, the “You talking to me?” Taxi Driver scene will go down in cinematic history. Probably more for its quotability but the directing and Robert De Niro’s performance are surely due the attention they deserve.

─────────────────────

What is a red herring in a story? Essentially, it’s a storytelling technique in which the writer plants false information to distract the reader from the truth. This type of deception is most commonly used in mysteries and the classic “whodunit.” In this video, we’re going to lay out this red herring definition, explore its origins, and provide five methods screenwriters and directors can use this technique.

Red herrings in movies are everywhere. They can be a clue, a character, any information that leads us to believe a truth that is later to be revealed as false. We most associate this concept with murder mysteries in which multiple suspects are investigated by both the detective and the audience. Writers don’t use red herrings in stories to be malicious, the audience actually appreciates the deception. But why? 

No one wants to spend hours reading a book or watching a movie if the mystery is easy to figure out. We want a challenge, that’s what keeps us engaged. And this is exactly what a red herring in literature and film provides.

Now that we understand the basic red herring definition, let’s expand our understanding with five different ways we can find red herrings in movies. First, as mentioned, we have the classic “whodunit” mystery, which is subverted by Agatha Christie herself in Murder on the Orient Express. Second, we can talk about how an unreliable narrator can generate red herring examples, most notably in The Usual Suspects. 

Third, we can leave the mystery genre altogether for red herrings in film that function more on emotion than plot. In Saving Private Ryan, the opening scene presents a possible future for our protagonist that the ending scene reveals to be false. By doing so, a great emotional catharsis is achieved that wouldn’t have been possible without a red herring. Fourth, writers like Quentin Tarantino can use actual history to subvert our expectations like he did in Inglourious Basterds and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood. 

Finally, what does red herring mean in the casting and marketing of a film? In Psycho, director Alfred Hitchcock gives us two excellent red herring examples in his two lead actors: Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Leigh is billed prominently in the poster and marketing of the film — which makes sense since she was the biggest star in the cast. So, when Hitchcock killed her off in the middle, the shock was immense. Likewise, Hitchcock purposefully cast Perkins for his “boy-next-door,” wholesome persona to divert our suspicions of him having anything to do with the murders.

03:48 Characters & Context (Wide Shot Framing)
05:58 Outro — The Chaos of Life

─────────────────────

Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins have collaborated on some of the most visually stunning movies in recent years. In this video, Villeneuve and Deakins discuss their approach to visual storytelling in films like Sicario and Prisoners. Specifically, how cinematic lighting was used in their favorite scene from Sicario, how “cutting the frame” in composition focuses the audience, and how framing characters in wide shots can be just as effective as cutting in with close-ups.

In the first chapter, Deakins describes the technique of “cutting the frame,” in which shooting through a doorway or using the architecture of the set helps simplify the image. This effectively reduces the visual information and allows the viewer to focus where you want them to. In certain contexts or genres, this film composition technique can also create tension, as if these characters are unknowingly being watched.

In a scene that concludes Kate’s (Emily Blunt) character arc in Sicario, she is threatened by Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who holds a gun to her head to sign a document. As Deakins and Villeneuve point out, it’s such a simple scene in terms of cinematography techniques and film composition — two people sitting at a table talking. But the real visual storytelling is carried by the cinematic lighting. Kate is more evenly lit and exposed, while Alejandro is backlit, lurking and dangerous in the shadows.

For the final chapter, Villeneuve and Deakins talk about the director’s preference for holding shots or even entire scenes in wide shots. The example they point to comes in Sicario after the extraction/border shootout. As the rest of the team heads into the building, the camera stays wide to capture a tense argument between Kate and Matt (Josh Brolin) in the distance. Instead of cutting in with standard coverage, Kate is left alone, isolated in a wide shot. This type of visual storytelling challenges the viewer by breaking the rules of film composition.

As you approach visual storytelling in your next project, remember these tips. Use cinematic lighting to enhance the power of a simple dialogue scene; shoot through doors or around corners to focus the audience’s attention and/or create tension; and experiment with wide shots when showing a character in context as a more effective way to communicate their mental state.

08:35 Final Takeaways

Drive (2011) is a film that works on many levels simultaneously. The fast cars and the ultraviolence are expertly juxtaposed with the now-iconic synth-driven soundtrack. There are many aspects to admire in Nicolas Winding Refn’s ode to L.A. crime movies but in this Drive video essay, we wanted to look at something very specific. In the Drive opening scene, we get a tense and heart-stopping car chase. But it’s not just the editing or camerawork that is driving the suspense — it’s the sound design.

Throughout the Drive opening scene, layers of sound are added to the mix to help generate suspense. In any suspenseful scene, we need three things: consequences, uncertainty, and time. If any one of these elements is missing, the whole thing falls apart. Let’s look at how Nicolas Winding Refn used these layers of sound to fulfill these criteria.

Consequences — obviously, we know the consequences that await Driver and his criminal passengers if they are caught. The alarm blasting from the break-in, the police sirens in the distance, and the helicopter roaring overhead all remind us of the danger involved in this operation.
Uncertainty — will Driver be caught by the police? We see very little of the police but we know they’re there and we know they’re closing in. This information is delivered through Driver’s police scanner as we follow the progress of the search.

Time — time is running out from the moment Driver starts his analog stopwatch. The music sounds like a racing heartbeat with a metronome-like rhythm. And to top it off, Driver has timed everything to the conclusion of a basketball game, which he listens to on the radio.

The cinematography obviously plays its own role in the scene but the real hero here is the soundtrack. By isolating our perspective to inside the car, our vision is limited and we rely almost exclusively on what we hear. Drive is a showstopping showcase of the Nicolas Winding Refn directing style and Drive’s first scene is a masterclass in sound design and suspense.

What is deus ex machina? It’s a phrase that is tossed around a lot and there seems to be a lot of debate on how we should define deus ex machina. Most people agree this is a plot device that writers should avoid at all costs but is the deus ex machina really that bad? In this video, we’ll explain the origins of this maligned plot device, how it has evolved over the centuries, and how writers today can avoid falling into its trap.

First, what does deus ex machina mean? It is a Latin phrase that translates to “god from the machine” and its origins go all the way back to Ancient Greek theater. In those plays, the “god from the machine” was an actor playing a deity who is lowered onto the stage with a pulley system. This god then intervenes and resolves the climactic conflict for the protagonist. This device was criticized as a contrivance and thus began its reputation as “bad” or “lazy” writing. 

No matter how fantastical a story is, it must obey the rules of its own internal logic. For example, Neo learns that within the Matrix, rules like gravity can be bent or even broken. In the climax, Neo stops an onslaught of bullets in mid-air. Therefore, this resolution works. However, in the climax of The Matrix Reloaded, Neo uses his god-like powers to neutralize attacking sentinels in the real world. This changing of the rules can be confusing for the audience because it appears to break the film’s internal logic.

Another problem that leads to deus ex machina examples is when the resolution is made possible with previously unknown information. A classic example of this is The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy accidentally splashes the Wicked Witch with water, which causes her to disintegrate. Since Dorothy was unaware that water would have this effect, her victory is pure luck and nothing more. This isn’t automatically a problem but it does lessen the resolution and can leave the audience underwhelmed.

Finally, our last type of “god from the machine” is generated by pure coincidence. A deus ex machina example that seems to fall into this trap is from The Phantom Menace. During the climactic battle, young Anakin starts firing from his downed ship and he just happens to destroy the entire station, which disables the entire droid army. This is an echo of Luke’s destruction of the Death Star in Episode IV, which (for most people) was a much more satisfying resolution because the success is intentional and not accidental.

To avoid these traps in your own writing, there are a few tips to follow. Make sure the payoff in the end is properly set up, minimize the “coincidence” factor, maintain the story’s internal logic, and, above all, keep your protagonist actively involved in the resolution.

04:19 Spirals in Production Design
08:08 Spiral Story Structure
12:01 Motifs in Movies Exercise — American Beauty

There are a few motifs in Vertigo (1958) but none are more dominant or meaningful than the spiral. From the higher-level themes like life/death/rebirth and obsession down to the details like hairstyling and props, the spiral is everywhere in Hitchcock’s Vertigo film. In this Vertigo analysis, we’ll identify and break down all the ways the spiral becomes both a visual motif and a thematic motif.

Scottie (James Stewart) is a retired detective who suffers from vertigo after a traumatic accident. Then an old friend tasks him with following his wife, Madeleine — who he believes is possessed with the spirit of a dead woman. Scottie’s investigation leads him into a mystery built upon deceit and obsession. 

And the perfect symbol for this journey is the spiral.

So, how exactly does the spiral become not only one of the dominant motifs in Vertigo but perhaps the crown jewel of all Hitchcock motifs? Let’s start at the beginning — before we see anything, we hear Bernard Hermann’s magnificent score. It is a strange pattern of notes consisting of two scales (one rising and one falling) played simultaneously. Then we see the opening credit sequence, designed by the inimitable Saul Bass, which is a hypnotic and abstract collection of literal spiral patterns furthering our disorientation.

But the spiral motifs in Vertigo don’t end there. We find the spiral twist hairstyle in both Madeleine and the portrait of Carlotta Valdez. The redwood stump is the perfect spiral metaphor, as Madeleine describes her past life — “Here I was born, and here I died.” The design of the belltower staircase is yet another spiral we return to repeatedly. And finally, the structure of the film itself is a spiral as the second half repeats locations, scenes, and actions from the first half. There are many reasons to fall in love with Hitchcock’s Vertigo and perhaps his use of the spiral motif is what lures us in and keeps us returning again...and again...and again.

The Pulp Fiction dance scene shouldn’t really work, right? A twist contest in the middle of a black comedy gangster movie? And, yet, it does. In perhaps any other director’s hands, this could have been a Razzie-winning laughing stock. In this Pulp Fiction analysis essay, we put on Quentin Tarantino’s dancing shoes to see how this unlikely sequence came together. 

In reality, the Pulp Fiction dance scene is a tipping point of sorts for Vincent (John Travolta). He’s fully aware that any slip-up with the boss’s wife will end very badly for him. Vincent begins the “date” calm, reserved and a tad nervous. But by the time Ed Sullivan announces the Jackrabbit Slim’s Twist Contest, Vincent lets his guard down completely.

So, we have to talk about the underlying tension and subtext roiling beneath the surface. But we also have to consider the location for this battle of wills. Jackrabbit Slim’s is an explosion of naive and innocent nostalgia — it is a hive of teenyboppers, cool cats, vintage cars, and $5 shakes. In other words, a mobster’s wife and a heroin-tripping henchman have absolute zero business being in a place like Jackrabbit Slim’s. And this is the point.

Vincent has been dropped into a place that begs him to have fun, let loose, and forget the fact that his life may be on the line. Vincent and Mia’s conversation starts a bit stilted and awkward. To augment this, Tarantino frames them in off-center medium singles which keep them separate and unbalanced. But then, as they begin to loosen up and bond, we start seeing center-framed close-ups followed by over-the-shoulder two-shots. In other words, Quentin Tarantino and his editor Sally Menke are smartly using “invisible” techniques like camera framing and editing to guide the mood of the scene from awkward to comfortable and from polite to flirtatious.

Once they start boogieing to Chuck Berry’s “You Never Can Tell,” Tarantino and Menke only use 4 shots for the entire Pulp Fiction dance scene. A wide shot that allows all eyes to see them (ours and the other patrons in Jackrabbit Slim’s) to raise expectations and a slow push-in to build anticipation. This is followed by two handheld shots that track the “give and take” between Vincent and Mia. Finally, a profile two-shot that locks onto them just as their eyes are locked onto each other. Their “boring, get-to-know-you chit chat” in the booth was just the beginning — their real conversation is happening here on the dance floor. And Vincent is more doomed than ever.

There is a common assumption about the Quentin Tarantino directing style, especially in his earlier films, that it is all style and no substance. The excess of pop culture references in Jackrabbit Slim’s and the Pulp Fiction dance scene are superficially just “fun.” But when you consider the challenge Vincent faces, all the “fun” stuff has a real and dramatic purpose.

David Fincher is a director’s director. His reputation for having complete control over his work is well-known but many directors have had similar power. So, what makes his approach to film directing so captivating? In this David Fincher video essay, we’ll let the man speak for himself. Through a collection of interviews from throughout his career, Fincher guides us through some of the strongest characteristics of his directing style.

To date, over the past four decades, David Fincher has directed a plethora of music videos, commercials, and 11 feature films. Along the way, he has refined his directing style which can be summed up in two words: precise and purposeful. When watching any David Fincher movies, you would be hard-pressed to find an out-of-place camera movement, or a lazy frame composition. One lesson we learned from Fincher is how he balanced and imbalanced the frame during Nick and Amy’s first meeting in Gone Girl to show the “push and pull” of their flirting.

Another well-known staple of the David Fincher directing style is his predilection for shooting multiple takes. He famously shot 99 takes of the opening scene in The Social Network, for example. But there’s a method to his madness — he wants the actors to move “beyond muscle memory” especially in their domestic environments. In Fincher’s logic, when the actor sits on their couch, they need to have sat in it a hundred times to make it look like they’ve sat in it a hundred times.

Fincher also explains how he creates mood and tone with lighting, color, and music. With a darker frame, desaturated color, and the brooding tones of Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, there certainly is a distinct experience watching David Fincher films. While all of this sounds extreme, the proof that he’s doing something right is visible on-screen.

Bob Yeoman is a cinematographer and a bit of a chameleon. He’s shot movies for directors like Gus Van Sant, Kevin Smith, and Roman Coppola. But his most consistent and well-known collaboration over the last three decades has been with Wes Anderson. Starting with Anderson’s first film Bottle Rocket, Yeoman has shot every live action film for the auteur since. In this video, Bob Yeoman walks us through his approach to cinematography in general and how Wes Anderson shoots movies specifically.

For The Grand Budapest Hotel, Yeoman discusses how the main hotel set was able to be mostly lit with practical lights, allowing them to blaze through scenes. He also recalls a moment of precise and precarious camera operating on top of a 5-story platform in the middle of the hotel. The scene called for him to whip pan between multiple characters and positions during a gunfight but found himself struggling to hit each position accurately without shaking the platform. His solution was to mount a laser pointer on the camera pointing down at marks he made on the floor.

For camera lenses, Yeoman explains how they would use mostly a single focal length on the early Wes Anderson movies like Bottle Rocket, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. For Moonrise Kingdom, he admits that even though the zoom lenses they used tended to lack the definition of the prime lenses, he was outvoted by Anderson. Bob Yeoman also relates how his transition to more digital filmmaking has been facilitated by LED film lighting. He explains how the flexibility of Skypanels have still given him the cinematic lighting he’s looking for.

Wes Anderson cinematography is a defining characteristic of Wes Anderson movies. Even Anderson’s stop-motion movies shot by Tristan Oliver bear his signature look. But the contributions of cinematographer Bob Yeoman cannot be understated.

HTEUXulCJZY,3 Types of Satire Every Storyteller Should Know — Horatian vs. Juvenalian vs. Menippean Satire,2021-07-26 11:00:13+00:00,"The history and types of satire including Horatian satire, Juvenalian satire, and Menippean satire.

What is Satire? ►► https://bit.ly/wis-3
Satire Examples in Film ►► https://bit.ly/sat-ex

Chapters:
00:00 Intro: The 3 Types of Satire
03:03 Origins of Satire
03:47 Horatian Satire: Light in Tone & Milder Critiques
07:40 Juvenalian Satire: Dark in Tone & Harsher Critiques
11:30 Menippean Satire: Targeting Morals & Beliefs
15:05 Satire Example: 3 Steps for Creating Satire

What is satire? It's easy to throw out a quick satire definition, but many people don’t truly understand the origins of satire or the characteristics of satire. In fact, there are three types of satire, each with their own approach, targets, and goals. In this explainer, we’ll take it back to Ancient Greece and Rome to see the origin of satire and how it branched out into Horatian satire, Juvenalian satire, and Menippean satire. 

In general, we can define satire as a storytelling genre that mocks, ridicules, and criticizes perceived wrongs in our society and belief systems. Therefore, one of the main functions of satire is to inspire change intended to “right these wrongs.” The method with which each writer or filmmaker uses satire to achieve that change varies between the three main types of satire. So, where can we use satire? Let’s jump into some of the most popular satirical examples in film history that answer that question. 

Our first and one of the most popular types of satire comes from Horace (65 BC — 8 BC), a Roman writer known for playfully mocking leading figures of his day in his work. Horatian satire is usually comedic in tone and the critique can be mild — it’s more of a playful mockery than an abrasive condemnation. In our video, we chose Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove as one of the best satirical examples in the Horatian mode. The film takes aim at the absurdity of nuclear brinkmanship and the cartoonish leaders responsible for it.

Next, we have Juvenalian satire, which is one of the more darker and antagonistic kinds of satire. Named for the caustic Roman writer Juvenal (1st Century AD — 2nd Century AD), this mode of satire is light on comedy and much more pointed in its criticism of social institutions like government, politicians, and class structures. A fantastic modern example of Juvenalian satire is Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite — which tackles capitalism and the way it forces both the rich and poor to act like parasites.

Finally, we’ll look at Menippean satire, which can vary wildly in tone but focuses its critiques on mental attitudes and belief systems such as racism and religion. This satiric mode of storytelling is named after Menippus (3rd Century BC) even though all of his own writings are lost to time — all we have are other contemporaneous writers discussing his work. We chose Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit as our main example of Menippean satire because it turns a very serious and dangerous historical movement (Nazi Germany) into something completely absurd.

No matter the social institution or belief system you feel needs changing, one of these main types of satire can be the ideal vehicle to deliver your message and bring change to the world.

02:10 - Business Card Scene Analysis
07:56 - Wrap Up

CORRECTION: Anatomy of a Scene was a New York Times production, not The Washington Post.

It’s been more than 20 years but the American Psycho business card scene is still on our minds. But why? For one, director Mary Harron approached the scene as a duel — instead of swords or pistols, we have business cards. In this American Psycho analysis, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of Mary Harron and how she took a great script and directed a fantastic scene.

The American Psycho business card scene isn’t really about business cards. The business cards are status symbols, a measurement for how superficial and competitive our ensemble of corporate clones really are. It is a battle fought with font types and card stock but that’s what makes it interesting. If anything, screenwriters and directors can take away from the American Psycho business card scene that subtext is powerful and a symbolic battle can be just as effective as a battle fought with actual weapons.

So, how does Mary Harron turn this boardroom brawl into an iconic and cinematic scene? Props, wardrobe, sound design, and cinematography are all working together to give us a pitch perfect satire. The business cards are designed to be nearly identical, which is what makes the characters’ in-depth comparisons so ironic. They all look and dress the same, down to the glasses, hairstyles and suits. 

Mary Harron also chose to give the business cards an extra layer of symbolism in the sound design. Listen closely and you can hear the sound of a sword being drawn as Patrick Bateman’s business card holder is opened. Then, the moment of truth: Paul Allen’s business card. Unlike the other cards, which are photographed rather plainly, Allen’s card gets extra special treatment. The lighting is more dramatic, the framing is large and imposing, and the slight slow motion turns this into the moment that sends Bateman over the edge.

If you’re thinking about writing or directing a satire, the American Psycho business card scene is a masterclass.

09:37 Get The Graduate Script & Storyboards

The Graduate ending might just be one of the greatest conclusions in cinema history. There must be a reason we’re still enthralled with the plight of Ben and Elaine more than five decades later. Part of its greatness can be attributed to just how expected...and then unexpected it plays out. In our contribution to The Graduate video essay conversation, we look at this sequence through the eyes of director Mike Nichols.

In the script, the ending plays out how we might expect: Ben valiantly rescues Elaine from her own wedding and they ride off into the sunset on a public bus. For all of this, the audience is right there with Ben, cheering and championing his extra-romantic gesture. But The Graduate ending wouldn’t be The Graduate ending we still talk about today if it ended there. Sitting at the back of the bus, under the lifeless gaze of the other passengers, Ben and Elaine transform in front of our eyes. In a single, extended two-shot, Mike Nichols shows us the adrenaline (and certainty) drain from the young lovers’ faces as reality sets in. 

Ben has been aimless and drifting since his graduation; he has no clue what to do with his life. After an ill-conceived affair with Mrs. Robinson fails to fill Ben’s existential void, he finds love and companionship in Elaine. For Ben, he’s finally found his purpose and he’ll stop at nothing to get her back. And, so, he does. But in that last shot, Mike Nichols poses a follow-up question to Ben, Elaine, and the audience: what now?

Why is The Graduate so timeless? The short answer is that it deals with themes and realities that apply to all of us. In the end of most movies, the protagonists find what they’re looking for but Mike Nichols gave us something else: uncertainty. Perhaps, it is this level of honesty that audiences still resonate with 50+ years later.

Lens choice is something all filmmakers should take seriously. Each focal length brings a different texture and feeling to a shot, so choosing a lens should be anything but arbitrary. With camera lens choice, the distance between cold and detached vs. warm and intimate is literally millimeters. In this episode of our series on Cinematography Techniques, we give the floor once again to the inimitable cinematographer Roger Deakins. Deakins expounds on how to choose a camera lens, storytelling with cinematography, and what to look for in a camera lens.

In the first segment, Roger Deakins expresses his love for prime lenses as opposed to zoom lenses. For one, he appreciates the specificity required when using primes — forcing the decision-making behind choosing a lens to be deliberate and intentional. With a zoom lens, the options remain open and the chance of choosing a lens for pure convenience supersedes choosing a lens for storytelling value.

Then the conversation moves onto shooting excessive coverage vs. the more classical approach where shots were more economical and meaningful. He refers to John Ford as a director who never shot coverage. Each shot feels designed to capture the human emotions at work with “creating” the emotions with coverage and editing.

In the final section, Deakins chats about his disinterest in “destroying” the image with techniques like flares, artifacts, lens breathing, and vignetting. Exceptions being when the storytelling really calls for such effects, like he did on The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. In the end, the art of how to choose a camera lens will inform everything else about the images you’re creating. The lighting, framing, production design, performances — the make or break point often starts with lens choice.

Time is at the core of many Christopher Nolan movies. It is the dominant motif on textual and subtextual levels. But how deep does this relationship between Nolan and time really go? In our latest Christopher Nolan video essay, our goal is to identify all the various elements in Nolan’s filmmaking where time plays an important role and what these efforts all add up to. From the script, the imagery, and even the soundtrack, let’s figure out how Christopher Nolan makes us see, hear, and feel time.

You can find Nolan’s infatuation with time in his screenplays, both in the plots but also the way they are structured. Whether written individually or co-written, many of Nolan’s scripts work on both these levels. Memento is told backwards and forwards simultaneously; The Prestige uses a non-linear structure to weave together a story of past and present; Dunkirk blends three different timelines into one. 

We can also find time represented in the imagery itself. Consider the extensive use of slow-motion in Inception, which gives us the audience a way to mark time in the various dream levels. Or the mind-blowing mix of forward and reverse motion in Tenet. 

Finally, the soundtrack is yet another venue to showcase the relationship between Nolan and time. With Inception, Nolan and his long-time composer Hans Zimmer took Edith Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien” and turned it into something quite fascinating. As time slows in the various dream levels, the song itself stretches out into something almost unrecognizable. Zimmer then built much of his score around this slow-mo version. In Dunkirk, along with an ever-present ticking watch on the soundtrack, Nolan and Zimmer utilized the Shepard Tone. The Shepard Tone is an audio illusion where an ascending or descending scale appears to endlessly rise or fall. 

Christopher Nolan and time will go down in history as one of the most consistent and elaborate pairings of artist and motif. This doesn’t mean that all filmmakers should focus on time but the lesson is to find a motif that speaks for the film and inject it into as many layers as possible.

Cinematographer Robert Richardson has been shooting some of the most visually dynamic and thrilling pictures of the last four decades. JFK, Natural Born Killers, Casino, Kill Bill, Shutter Island, The Hateful Eight, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — just a sample of Robert Richardson’s career timeline. In this video, Richardson describes his early days working with Oliver Stone, his unique approach to cinematography techniques, and his role in supporting his director’s vision.

Bob Richardson’s career began in documentaries while shooting active combat in El Salvador. This caught the attention of Oliver Stone and their creative partnership yielded such cinematic powerhouse films as Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, Nixon and more. The next major collaboration in Robert Richardson’s career came in the form of Martin Scorsese — they’ve made a number of films together, including Bringing out the Dead, The Aviator, Hugo, and others.

In his most recent partnership, cinematographer Robert Richardson has shot nearly every film for Quentin Tarantino since Kill Bill. This list includes Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

Despite working with such visionary auteurs, Robert Richardson has been able to bring a unique style to his cinematography. Specifically, cinematography techniques such as bright overhead lighting, balletic tracking shots, and colored lighting.

With zero signs of slowing down, cinematographer Robert Richardson has been an unsung hero working with these mainstream auteurs. But, as he explains, he understands that his job is to support the director’s vision, revealing layers of humility and true collaboration at the heart of his work.

qkZYxRZKhRU,[Tutorial] How to Sync Script Revisions in StudioBinder — Video Production Essentials,2021-06-17 11:00:18+00:00,"In this video, we show you how to add a new scene to an existing StudioBinder project the proper way, so it syncs throughout your entire project (shooting schedule, shot lists, script breakdowns, etc).

Write Your Script in StudioBinder for FREE ►► http://bit.ly/sb-scw

In film production and video production, preparation is huge. Breaking down the script, putting together a budget, creating a shot list — there’s a lot to it. But what happens in the middle of your production planning when a new scene gets added to the project? Does your production scheduling go out the window? Does all the Pre-production work you’ve already completed now need to be re-organized? The quick answer is no. In this quick StudioBinder tutorial, we’ll cover the minimal steps needed when adding a new scene, and how one click of a button syncs that new scene across the entire application.

Step 1 is to open your screenplay and locate where the new scene should be added. For our purposes, let’s say this is in-between scenes 3 and 4. When you create a new scene heading (Step 2), the software automatically designates this as Scene 3A — not Scene 4. Why is this? Why not simply renumber each subsequent scene? Because so much of film production planning is based on a locked script with fixed scene numbers and page numbers.

Step 3 is to write your new scene. Looking at the screenplay, it appears that the new scene has been added — but until you complete the next step, Scene 3A will not appear anywhere else in your StudioBinder project.

Step 4 is click “Sync your project.” This will bring up a window showing the current version of the script, with existing scene numbers, on the left and the new version, including the new scene, on the right. Once you click “apply changes,” Scene 3A will now be synchronized through each module of the project. This includes the breakdown, the schedule, the shot list and storyboard — everywhere.

And the beauty of this is that all that Pre-production work you completed previously remains unchanged. Now, you can proceed with the rest of your video production without interruption. In other words, you can keep your production productive.

The Joker Murray scene — you know the one we’re talking about. It is a devastating piece of cinema and a masterclass in how to write and direct suspense, tension, and sudden violence. In this Joker video essay, we’re going to put ourselves in Todd Phillips’ shoes as we reverse-engineer what made the “Joker kills Murray scene” so gripping and thrilling.

On its own, the Joker Murray scene still exhibits a fair amount of tension. However, in the context of the rest of the movie, it is an absolute powder keg waiting to explode. Everything in this movie has been building towards this moment — a key ingredient to any climactic finale. We’ve seen Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) idolize Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and dream of one day appearing on the show. And then we saw Arthur’s humiliation when Murray mocks his comedy routine, shattering that dream and sending him on a path of destruction.

As the scene begins, the lighting and camera work emulates a traditional talk show — flat lighting, wide shots, etc. The conversation begins innocently enough but when that turns, so does the visual style. Suddenly, we jump the 180-degree line and frame Joker and Murray from behind. The coverage includes intimate close-ups but also more objective wide shots to include the audience and the TV cameras broadcasting live.

And the tension builds. When Joker kills Murray Franklin, it is the ultimate punctuation. Despite the gruesome violence, we’re almost relieved to be rid of the unbearable anticipation. Which is precisely what director Todd Phillips was aiming for. The Joker Murray scene isn’t for the faint-hearted but if you can disengage from the violence, there is a lot to study in screenwriting, cinematography and film directing.

Wally Pfister is perhaps best known as the cinematographer on many Christopher Nolan movies. Collaborating with Nolan, the pair created some of the most thrilling and visually stunning blockbuster films in recent years. But where did Wally Pfister get his start in cinematography, how did he meet Christopher Nolan, and what were some of the cinematography techniques behind their work? In this video essay, Wally Pfister explains all.

Pfister got his start working with legendary producer Roger Corman, under the tutelage of an iconic cinematographer in his own right, Phedon Papamichael. After years of low-budget indie films, Wally met the newcomer Christopher Nolan at Sundance. The pair hit it off and got to work on Nolan’s second feature film, Memento. Once that movie broke out in a major way, Pfister would go on to shoot the next six Christopher Nolan movies, including Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises. Beyond his work with Nolan, Wally Pfister also delivered solid cinematography to films such as Moneyball and The Italian Job.

Even though Wally Pfister cherishes his work as a director of photography, he also desired to become a director. After an amicable separation from Nolan, Pfister directed his first feature film, Transcendence with Johnny Depp, TV episodes and commercials. Pfister’s story of breaking into Hollywood isn’t unique — starting small, learning cinematography techniques from the ground up, and developing fruitful collaborative relationships.

In this video skit, we witness a clash of personalities between a Producer named Donald and his disgruntled Prop Master, Travis. 

Collaboration in film production is obviously essential and StudioBinder is built to support and nurture such teamwork. Collaborators can use the comments sidebar to discuss anything, including finding last-minute replacement movie props instead of a genuine samurai sword. In this case, Prop Master Travis is able to upload various images to the scene notes for approval from Donald.

Thelma Schoonmaker is a film editor with a dazzling filmography and a career that spans 6 decades. Her most consistent and fruitful collaboration during those years has been with director Martin Scorsese. To date, they have joined creative forces on over 20+ feature films — making it near impossible to discuss Scorsese’s work without acknowledging Schoonmaker. In this short documentary, Thelma guides us through this working relationship and how some of these directing and film editing decisions get made.

After editing Scorsese’s first feature film, Who’s That Knocking at My Door, Schoonmaker would essentially become his full-time feature editor starting with Raging Bull. What she describes as part of their general approach is an editing style that is less concerned with a polished and perfect construction. Mistakes, bumps, jump cuts — she explains, “A lot of people think editing should be invisible, but we’ve never felt that way.”

For an example of these intentionally imperfect film editing techniques, look no further than The Irishman. As De Niro makes a difficult phone call, two different takes are spliced together with an obvious jump cut in the middle. Another example can be found in Goodfellas during Henry and Karen’s wedding — the violence of the glass being stepped motivates rougher, more jagged edits for the subsequent shots.

In film editing, artisans like Thelma Schoonmaker bring this sense of exploration and imperfection into a style all its own. Like any art form, the art of editing can be less dependent on precision and more focused on performance and emotional truth. If one wants to study the full breadth of film editing tips — the work of film editor Thelma Schoonmaker provides endless lessons.

How to start a movie — obviously, there is no single answer to that question but there are ways to find the perfect opening scene. The first scene in any story has a great burden placed on it and the decision of how to open a movie should be given careful consideration. In this video essay on the art of the opening scene, we will examine six methods that illustrate the various ways to begin a movie. Let’s start with how to introduce a villain or hero. 

When the ensuing story follows the combative relationship between a hero and villain, it can be advantageous to make those introductions as soon as possible. Especially, in the case of The Dark Knight — when we already know plenty about Batman from the earlier film — setting up his primary adversary for this chapter sets the bar for what he will be facing for the rest of the film. In Skyfall, even though we had our formal introduction to James Bond in Casino Royale, we can add a new layer onto both his characterization and plant a story problem for him in this new chapter. 

In Marriage Story, writer/director Noah Baumbach shows us how to start a movie with pure characterization. We are introduced right away to Charlie and Nicole with an extended montage of their personalities, and a brief history of their marriage. For this movie, this opening scene is perfectly suited to give us as much information and sympathy about this couple before we see their separation and divorce for the rest of the film. Without this opening sequence, our ability to sympathize can decrease.

In Uncut Gems, we skip the character introduction altogether and begin with the plot device that will kickstart and motivate the characters throughout. The opening scene takes place in an Ethiopian mine where a rare and mystical gem is unearthed. The power and influence this gem has is given center stage before we meet any characters. 

Finally, in La La Land and Get Out, we have two genre films (musical and horror, respectively) that begin with opening scenes meant to obey and break their genre rules. In La La Land, before the main character introductions, we get an explosive opening sequence full of bright colors, elaborate choreography, and a mix of fantasy and reality that musicals are known for. In Get Out, we have a mix of tones in the opening scene: both comedy and horror. This hybridization of the genres clues us in that the following movie will meet but also challenge the pre-established genre rules.

Whether you choose a character introduction, establish the character dynamics between the main characters, or set up the genre, how you begin a movie matters.

08:49 - Takeaways

The Casino Royale poker scene — or scenes — presented a unique challenge to director Martin Campbell and cinematographer Phil Meheux. There are basically three complete poker scenes in the film. So, not only did they have to keep up the exhilarating pace and spectacle from the film’s numerous bombastic action scenes, but they also went out of their way to make each poker scene different from the last. In this 007 video essay, let’s compare and contrast each Casino Royale poker scene to see how the directing, cinematography, and editing gave each one a distinct look and feel. The lesson here is to understand how to make a passive, sedentary scene visually compelling and how to never shoot the same scene twice the same way.

In an interview with American Cinematographer, director Martin Campbell lays out his main challenge when approaching the Casino Royale poker scene. He said, “How do you make 10 people around a table playing cards interesting?” Unlike any number of scenes of people sitting and talking, in this case, the communication is all done through the game mechanics, the eyelines, and with film language. 

Along with director of photography Phil Meheux, they decided to approach each Casino Royale poker scene with a different visual style. Meheux describes these approaches like this: “We did one card game that was all filmed with a static camera...another where the camera was constantly moving...then we did one game where the camera starts pretty far back and slowing closes in on Bond and Le Chiffre.”

In our breakdown of each Casino Royale poker scene, we can see this is true. They all have a slightly different visual language based on the ultimate goal of the scene. In Round 1, the camera is mostly still as Bond calmly gets a read on Le Chiffre, waiting to spot his tell. In Round 2, the average shot length slows down but the pace picks up with some strategically placed camera movements. In the final round, Campbell and Meheux opt for a combination of kinetic and still camera work to build tension towards Bond’s ultimate victory.

As you approach your next project with similar scenes, especially those as undynamic as characters sitting around a table, take a cue from Martin Campbell, Phil Meheux, and the entire team behind the Casino Royale poker scene. Put all your cards on the table and use the nuances of film language to your advantage.

Most main characters in a story change in some way but not all changes are positive. In Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay for The Social Network, we get an excellent example of a Negative Change Arc. 

In our Social Network video essay, we’re going to work through Sorkin’s screenplay using concepts of how to write a character arc by author KM Weiland. In this Social Network analysis, we’ll find out the depths that characters like Mark Zuckerberg will go to achieve their wants vs needs.

In this last episode of our series on the 4 Endings to Every Film, we’ll look at what we call a Bitter-Sweet Ending. This is when the protagonist achieves what they want, but fails to get what they really need. In Zuckerberg’s case, his want is to do something substantial to get noticed by the elite final clubs at Harvard. His need, which is also established in the very first scene, is to become more selfless and develop his relationship skills.

Of the many screenwriting techniques necessary to know how to write a character arc, finding their “lie” is a top priority. Weiland describes this as “The Lie the Character Believes,” which is an assumption about themselves or the world around them this is false — but they believe wholeheartedly. In a Fall Arc, Weiland explains that the character’s want is often directly tied to the “lie” and that the decisions they make lead them further into the lie as they pursue their want.

In The Social Network, Mark’s lie is that he feels that by simply being accepted into the social elite groups at Harvard, it will “lead to a better life.” In his pursuit, he encounters Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss twins who contract Mark to help them build an exclusive social network for Harvard students. Instead of playing by the rules, Mark decides to steal their idea and turn it into something all his own — and, thus, Facebook is born. Along his path to success, Mark absolutely achieves everything he thought he wanted. But it came at a price — his close personal relationships. First, his girlfriend, Erica, and then, more importantly, his friendship and partnership with Eduardo. In this Negative Change Arc, Mark embraced the “lie,” rejected the “truth” and ended up alone — the youngest billionaire in the world without a single meaningful relationship in his life.

How to location scout for a film — it’s a question that faces every filmmaker during Pre-Production. Will sets need to be built or does the perfect location already exist? Is it cost-effective to shoot on location or will building the location from scratch actually save money? These are the questions Roger Deakins answers on his podcast, Team Deakins. In this video essay, we’ll let Deakins take the driver’s seat as he relays the real-world challenges he faced in location scouting on films like Skyfall, No Country for Old Men, and Blade Runner 2049. 

For Deakins, the process starts at the storyboard stage. Before location scouting can even begin, the conceptualization starts in Pre-Production. Identifying the needs of the scene and the logistics involved gives you clear objectives when location scouting for a film. Granted, for larger budget productions, the decision can be made upfront whether these scenes should be shot on stage vs. on location.

On Skyfall, Roger Deakins encountered two such situations. As he explains, location scouting for the iconic Shanghai skyscraper encounter was initially planned to be shot on location. But when faced with the potential budget considerations, Deakins was able to replicate the office building on a soundstage where budget and logistics could be much more easily controlled.
Similarly, the abandoned island city set off the coast of Macau was initially considered to be shot on location in Japan. Again, rather than incur the massive expense, Deakins explains the workaround was to use stills taken during the original location scout as a reference for VFX artists to recreate the island digitally. 

Even if a production has a Hollywood budget, there are still less expensive and creative solutions when location scouting. Knowing how to location scout for a film isn’t just knowing what locations already exist, it’s understanding all of the alternatives available to make the best decision for the story, the budget, and the film.

How to write a character arc — this is a topic in screenwriting that is endlessly pursued and desperately necessary. Almost all characters in almost all stories change in some way, and this is what we mean by “what is a character arc.” No matter their personality or backstory, which can be specific and unique, there are fundamental and universal ways that all characters change. And when you understand these mechanics of character arcs, actually writing character arcs can become an intuitive as well as creative process.

In this video essay on screenwriting techniques, we look specifically at the 1986 Oscar-winning screenplay for Rain Man and how the positive change character arc is masterfully executed. As part of our on-going series on The 4 Ways to End a Film, this third chapter focuses on character arcs — how they are created and how they evolve during the narrative. We’ll also cover how “want vs need” is employed to inform and balance the character arc from start to finish.

Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a character ripe for positive change. We first meet him as a shady importer of foreign cars, up to his neck in debt, and a serial liar. When news of his father’s death reaches him, all Charlie wants is his inheritance. Unfortunately, the entire inheritance has been bestowed upon a trustee, a Charlie’s heretofore unknown brother, Raymond. Charlie essentially kidnaps Raymond in an attempt to gain custody of him — not because he wants to care for his brother but so he can gain access to the inheritance. On their road trip back to California, Charlie learns valuable lessons about his past, his family, and reconnects with Raymond in ways that change him inside and out.

In her book, Creating Character Arcs, KM Weiland gives us a few key screenwriting techniques that we can apply to our analysis of Rain Man. First, we have what she calls the “Character’s Ghost,” which is that element in their past that haunts them. For Charlie, it’s his sour and unresolved relationship with his father. To break through his character arc, Charlie must confront and eradicate that ghost. 

Another key to writing character arcs is something Weiland calls the “Impact Character.” This is someone that “slams into your protagonist, catalyzes him into change, and has a major impact on his life.” Obviously, Raymond is Charlie’s impact character and pushes him through his character arc — without even trying.

Charlie’s character arc saw him transform from selfish to selfless, while resolving some deep-seated anger. Charlie gave up his “want” (the money) when he found his “need” (internal resolution) and this makes Rain Man such a great example of how to write a character arc.

Parasite (2019) cleaned house at Oscars, winning multiple awards with a parable of social inequality. Beyond the exquisite directing and cinematography, the Parasite script is also worth appreciating. Not only does it follow (and subvert) classic story structure, co-writers Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin Won managed to weave in complex and nuanced themes. The end result is a surprising, evocative and ground-breaking story. In this Parasite video essay, we’re going to map out the 15 story beats of the Parasite script using Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat beat sheet.

To have the Parasite movie explained, we can turn to the Save the Cat story beats. In the “Opening Image,” we get our first glimpse of the Kim family’s impoverished life in a sub-basement. Most pro-actively trying to pull his family out of this less-than-ideal existence is the son, Ki-woo. He believes that with hard work and ingenuity, upward mobility is possible. This is the “Theme Stated” beat, and we follow the Kims, led by Ki-woo, in their pursuit of this goal.

And then, the “Catalyst” that kicks the plot into motion. Ki-woo’s friend, Min, offers him an opportunity to take over as a tutor for the wealthy Park family. After initial doubts (the “Debate”), Ki-woo fabricates a resume and lands the job — and a new plan is formed. During the “Fun and Games” beat, Ki-woo’s father, mother and sister all procure jobs working for the Parks. Just as the Kims believe they have arrived at their new and comfortable life, the “Midpoint” flips their dreams and the direction of the story.

Moon-gwang, the Parks’ former housekeeper, returns to the house while the Kims celebrate. Unbeknownst to anyone, she has been harboring her husband in the Parks’ basement. A literal slip up puts the Kims at the mercy of Moon-gwang, and puts their chances of success at their lowest (“All is Lost”). In the following story beats in the Parasite script, the Kims’ subterranean house is flooded but even when Ki-woo’s father questions the idea of “having a plan,” Ki-woo doubles down and hatches a new plan.

The climax (“Finale”) of Parasite is a birthday party massacre leaving Ki-woo’s sister and Moon-gwang’s husband dead, while Mr. Park is killed by Ki-woo’s father. With his father hiding in the same basement under the Park’s house, and despite everything that’s happened, Ki-woo still stubbornly holds onto his belief that he can one day afford to legitimately buy the Park house and rescue his father.

The Parasite movie explained in these story beats allows for screenwriters to see how useful a formula like the Save the Cat beat sheet can be. Of course, Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin Won were also able to subvert traditional story structure with an ending that is both poignant and unexpected.

Chapters:
00:00 - Intro
00:17 - What is Chekhov's Gun?
03:21 - Knives Out Introduction
04:26 - Example 1 — The Blood Stain
06:19 - Example 2 — The Baseball
07:52 - Example 3 — The Knife Sculpture
09:42 - Takeaways

Chekhov’s Gun isn’t about guns, it’s about setup and payoff. Less a screenwriting technique and more a principle of storytelling, there’s a lot we can learn from Anton Chekhov’s gun. In this video essay, we’re going to investigate Knives Out, written and directed by Rian Johnson, as a case study in how Chekhov’s Gun works. In this tightly constructed murder mystery, where everyone is a suspect and everything is a clue, Johnson shows us the power of “setup and payoff” and the fun we get watching a master at work.

When considering how to implement Chekhov’s Gun into your own screenplay, there are three considerations you should make. First, there’s what we’re calling “visibility,” or how obvious you present the “gun” to the audience. Do you give us an extreme close-up with dramatic music to make sure we notice it? Or do you let it pass by without much mention?

The second consideration is “relevancy,” or how important the “gun” is to the story. Is the audience aware of its significance? Or does the role this “gun” has to play a mystery of its own? The last consideration is “velocity,” or how quickly the “gun” is fired once the audience is aware of its existence. Is it fired immediately for ultimate shock value? Or would it work best waiting in the background to let the suspense boil up?

In this Knives Out video essay, we look at each of Rian Johnson's many Chekhov’s Guns, each with their own role to play in solving the mystery and each with their own combination of these considerations. For example, the bloodstain on Marta’s shoe is highly visible, we know exactly what will happen if this is discovered, and this “gun” isn’t fired until the very last scene.

Remember, Chekhov’s Gun can and should be applied in every layer of your storytelling. From the dialogue, props, plot, and even theme. The lesson is simple: keep only what matters and discard the rest. The audience will appreciate a clean and intentional story written by a professional.

X3906cbElbQ,Motivated Lighting Examples by Roger Deakins — Cinematography Techniques Ep. 4,2021-03-29 11:00:10+00:00,"Roger Deakins walks us through his motivated lighting examples from 1917, No Country for Old Men, and Sicario.

01:04 — The Falling Lamp
02:11 — Oil Lamps in 1917
03:21 — Overhead Lights in Sicario
04:02 — Table Lamps

In this episode of Cinematography Techniques, Roger Deakins continues his conversation on the value of practical lights and motivated lighting. Specifically, he addresses lighting challenges in films like 1917, Sicario, and No Country for Old Men. 

Does the existing practical lighting in the set help tell the story? With film lighting, can we find a middle ground between artistic expression and narrative function? These are questions every cinematographer is confronted with at every location in every project. Let’s gather round and let Roger Deakins show us the light, literally, when it comes to using motivated lighting in film.

Deakins’ first example comes from a shootout scene in No Country for Old Men. In a motel room, the decision was made that a lamp should end up on the floor. This way, it would project light upwards on Anton Chigurh, casting him rather menacing, “noirish” light. This is a great example of blending practical lighting with motivated lighting with production design in a way that makes the clearly intentional choices seem organic and accidental.

In 1917, Roger Deakins explains how difficult it was to use motivated lighting in the bunker scene early in the film. The underground set is lit only with oil lamps, which would be historically accurate but would there be enough lighting with practicals alone? The solution was to fit two bulbs into the lamps — a rather simple but elegant fix to get cinematic lighting out of 100-year-old practical lights.

Finally, we have Roger Deakins on lighting the immigration detention scene in Sicario. Not a claustrophobic bunker as in 1917, now the challenge is lighting a massive area with dozens of extras. The existing sodium mercury lamps would not do so Deakins requested 50 conical lights to be fitted with 2K blondes. These were attached to the ceiling of the depot and gave enough illumination to the large set and multiple characters. 

Sometimes, practical lighting and motivated lighting require a small adjustment to the existing lighting conditions. And other times, as in this Sicario example, it requires a complete redesign of the lighting. We may not have the budget or resources that Roger Deakins has on a given project but the lessons here are universal — motivated lighting can give a location personality, and give the scene authenticity.

UlnRzUhe_WE,Pixar Storytelling — How the WALL-E Opening Scene Tells a Story Without Words,2021-03-22 11:00:18+00:00,"A look at the visual storytelling with sound design and character design in this Pixar video essay on WALL-E.

Best Pixar Movies Ranked ►► http://bit.ly/wll-e

00:56 - Setting the Scene
02:35 - Exercise: Beyond the Script
03:44 - Use ""Appeal"" for Character Design
05:46 - Recap

WALL-E isn’t just one of the best Pixar movies to date, it’s also a masterclass in visual storytelling. For a majority of the film, we get zero dialogue and yet a complicated and compelling story is unfolding in front of us. This isn’t impossible, it was done for decades before sound was introduced to motion pictures. WALL-E seems revolutionary because we’ve become so reliant on dialogue that we’ve forgotten the power of visual storytelling. 

In this Pixar video essay, we’re going to look at the first couple minutes of WALL-E to see how sound design, music, audio editing, and character design are all we need to tell a complete and nuanced story.

One of the most impressive feats in the opening minutes of WALL-E is how the combination of sound and image create and balance tone. The very first images we get show us the majesty and wonder of the universe. When soundtracked with a jaunty and peppy show tune (“Put On Your Sunday Clothes”), the tone is clear and consistent. It is an optimistic and adventurous call to action.
 
But then we plummet through Earth’s atmosphere to the surface and the imagery has taken on a completely different message...yet the music remains unchanged. Now we have the desolation of an abandoned planet that is juxtaposed with the unabashedly optimistic music. The tone, now, is complicated. 

And then, the music fades away, as if dissolved and carried away into the past. We are left with only the sound of hollow wind pushing through an apocalyptic landscape. The tone is once again balanced between matching sound and image, albeit on the pessimistic end of the spectrum. In 90 seconds, we have three distinct tonal shifts, all due to the aural and visual storytelling. This is masterful and economic filmmaking — and in a “kids movie” nonetheless!

The lesson here is that dialogue is important and can be used with great purpose and strategy. But as you approach your next project, don’t forget that visual storytelling, film language, sound design, character design, and audio editing are also equally important communication tools. Anyone can tell a story with dialogue, but can you tell a story with images and sound alone? Give it a shot and remember Pixar and WALL-E when you do.

07:08 - Wrapping Up

The Point of View Shot (also called the POV shot) is more than just one of the basic camera shots for filmmaking, it’s a direct connection to the characters on-screen. By looking through the character’s eyes, we take one step closer to empathizing with them. Whether we are meant to share their fear, their suspicion, or their love — the POV shot has proven to be an essential tool in filmmaking and directing. In this video essay, we’ve collected examples from many genres, eras, and perspectives to illuminate just how versatile the point of view shot really is. 

One of the most common applications of the POV shot has been in horror films and thrillers, especially when adopting the killer’s point of view. This can bring suspense and a heavy dose of dramatic irony to these moments — the thrill of watching and the fear of being watched. But this is just the beginning of how a filmmaker can use the POV shot.

Think of a romantic movie, when our lead first sees his love interest. We don’t just watch somebody fall in love, we have an opportunity to fall in love at the same time. Think of how much tension is added in found footage with point of view shots — when the unpredictability of the camerawork dictates what we will see...or not see.

In science fiction, and the realm of aliens and killer robots, we have an opportunity to see through a completely foreign point of view. It’s a clever technique that allows us to understand how strange and unfamiliar these characters are. The spy genre is perfectly suited for the POV shot — when watching characters from a distance is simply part of the job. With telephoto lenses, security cameras, and binoculars, the point of view shot is a natural choice.

Finally, the POV shot is perhaps the only way to visualize and experience a character’s mental state. Whether it’s drugs, alcohol, poison, or insanity, seeing through the character’s compromised point of view is a common filmmaking technique. This again can be used for a variety of outcomes — for drama, for terror, for humor, or something in between. By now, it should be clear that the point of view shot is a tool any filmmaker can use in almost any situation.

Wes Anderson and his first feature film, Bottle Rocket — this is the perfect underdog story of how a couple of scrappy college kids in Texas turned a short film into a filmmaking career. In these Wes Anderson interviews, along with his collaborators like Owen Wilson, we get a glimpse into the filmmaking process, how a spot at Sundance gives us no guarantees of success, and how failures can ultimately lead to successes. This is the making of Wes Anderson’s first film, Bottle Rocket.

Wes Anderson met his future collaborator, Owen Wilson, in a playwriting class in Austin, Texas. Their mutual love of film and filmmaking pushed them to scrape together a short film called Bottle Rocket. Shot in black & white on a painfully low budget, their comedic crime caper managed to land a coveted spot at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival. Hoping to capitalize on the situation, Anderson and Wilson were dismayed when no one responded to it. No one, that is, except producers Polly Platt and James L. Brooks.

With real Hollywood muscle and a $5M budget behind them, Wes Anderson turned his 13-minute short into his first feature film, also titled Bottle Rocket. Not only did Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson eventually turn their dream into a reality, but they also did so on their own terms. Upon release, however, Bottle Rocket was a box office failure but it did put Anderson and Wilson in a position to make Rushmore, and the rest is history.

When you look at the following Wes Anderson movies like Rushmore, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and others, you can see in Bottle Rocket the seeds of Wes Anderson’s style. What we also find in Bottle Rocket is the passion for filmmaking and the “never give up” attitude that every beginning filmmaker needs if they want to succeed.

Michael Corleone — the youngest son of a Mafia family who rises from passive non-participant to assume the throne as the next Godfather. In the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, the tragic tale of Michael Corleone’s rise and fall is nearly Shakespearean. In this character analysis, we will follow Michael’s fall from grace, the perfect example of a Corruption Arc, and discover what it takes to craft one of the 4 ending types — the Bitter ending.

In her book, Creating Character Arcs, author K.M. Weiland describes the Corruption Arc as “perhaps the most moving of all the arcs, since it features a character who is good — or at least has a great potential for goodness — but who throws away that chance and consciously chooses darkness.” When we first meet Michael Corleone in The Godfather, he is purposefully detached from the family’s organized crime. In an early scene, he confesses to his girlfriend, “That’s my family, Kay. That’s not me.” 

But when his father is nearly assassinated, Michael pledges his loyalty and vows revenge. Along this path of vengeance, Michael assumes control over the Corleone family and loses his soul bit by bit. In character development terms, this is a Negative Change Arc which leads to a Bitter ending, one of the four types of endings.

In a Bitter ending, the protagonist achieves neither their Want nor their Need. But what is the difference between Want vs Need? When constructing a character arc, their Want is something tangible, external, a goal that they actively pursue. A Need, on the other hand, is internal, a change the character needs to make to help them become a better person.

In the case of Michael Corleone, his initial Want is to live a normal life with Kay, outside the Mafia. His Need is to avoid the corruption that comes with such a life. At the end of The Godfather, Michael has become the new head of the family and lost his soul in the process. If you’re interested in learning how to write character arcs, one fantastic yet tragic example can be found in Michael Corleone and The Godfather, written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola.

Chiaroscuro Meaning: The term comes from the Italian words for “light” and “dark” — the perfect definition for a lighting style that mixes the two to great effect. Chiaroscuro lighting is a visually stunning technique that helps turn a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional scene.

It was Renaissance painters like Caravaggio that mastered this technique long before filmmakers got their hands on it. But when they did, they thrived in it. In this video essay, we’ll trace the roots of chiaroscuro lighting from Caravaggio, through German Expressionism, Film Noir, and everything in between. 

Like painting, cinema is (usually) a 2D medium. To add that third critical dimension, cinematic lighting can be used to create depth. Similar to how leading lines and shapes can guide the viewer’s eye to a perceived background in the distance, so too can light and shadow. In the early days of German Expressionism, cinematic lighting pushed the balance between light and dark to the extreme. The dark subject matter of these films could be enhanced by embracing shadows along with the light.

But beyond its ability to add dimensionality to the image, cinematic lighting techniques like chiaroscuro can also be used to emphasize the thematic questions posed in these films.
American filmmakers brought these cinematic lighting techniques to the gritty and pessimistic underworld in Film Noir classics. In these films, we find good characters led into corruption and the chiaroscuro lighting helped trap them in moral and existential dilemmas. Filmmakers figured out that there is tension between mixing light and shadow and have relied on the power of chiaroscuro lighting for over a century.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, director Stanley Kubrick crafted a sci-fi classic that asks big questions about human civilization. From our humble beginnings as nomadic hominids to our interstellar travels to Jupiter and beyond. In this video essay, we’ll step into Stanley Kubrick’s shoes (and what mighty shoes those are!) to see if we can understand the specific directing choices he made. Let’s look at the Dawn of Man prologue from 2001: A Space Odyssey through Stanley Kubrick’s eyes.

Before we can make any decisions in film directing, we need to look at the script. How do we take words on a page and turn them into images? For example, the black monolith that suddenly appears in the hominids’ world. In the screenplay by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke initially describes it as a translucent cube that acts like a television screen. Of course, this is not what the black monolith looks like in the final version of 2001 — this is a much more ambiguous and mysterious design.

As our lead hominid Moonwatcher sits playing with a pile of bones, the influence of the black monolith clicks. Moonwatcher takes a leg bone and discovers the power of man’s first weapon. To mark the significance of this moment — the literal Dawn of Man — Kubrick shifts the visual style completely. From static, wide and objective shots, we suddenly jump into more abstract and subjective imagery. Slow motion is added to the effect, amplifying the moment’s monumental status. 

In 2001 A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick took a wordless prologue and crafted an unforgettable cinematic moment. In film directing, there are endless options at your disposal, including the framing, lens choice, music, and production design. If we can learn anything from how Stanley Kubrick directed 2001: A Space Odyssey, it starts by isolating each decision being made and understanding the role it plays in the overall presentation.

Frame rate matters and anyone who tells you otherwise isn’t paying attention. From the creative aspects like slow motion, to the practical considerations like being able to mix frame rates in the edit — the amount of frames per second you shoot matters. In this video, we’ll answer the following questions: What is frame rate? Does frame rate matter? And what frame rate should I use for video? This is the Ultimate Guide to Frame Rate Explained.

FPS Explained: Frame rate is measured as frames per second (fps), or the number of still images captured by the camera or presented by the projector every second. For decades, the standard frame rate (what some call the cinematic frame rate) has been 24 fps. Since digital cameras came into the picture the frame rates commonly run at 30 fps, 60 fps, or even 120 fps. Since the number of frames per second has a direct relationship with the “smoothness” of the motion, you might assume that a high frame rate is always better. But it all depends on the look you’re going for.

They call 24 fps the cinematic frame rate because it “looks” like movies do. The amount of motion blur associated with that particular frame rate can be achieved in digital formats, which is an aesthetic choice many videographers make. With The Hobbit, director Peter Jackson chose to shoot and present the films at 48 fps to create a more immersive 3D experience. More recently, director Ang Lee topped that with films like Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk and Gemini Man at a whopping 120 fps.

Some filmmakers have gone the other direction, away from “smooth and perfect” motion to something noticeably jagged and smeared. Directors like Wong Kar Wai, Tony Scott, and Quentin Tarantino have used a process called step printing, in which they shoot as low as 6 fps and “copy/paste” each frame 4 times to create 24 fps. Along with an open shutter, we get a normal rate of motion but with the look and feel of slow motion. 

No matter if you’re working in cinematography or videography, frame rate matters. As you build your shot list and storyboard, remember these considerations and how frame rate works. Frame rate, like every other creative decision, has a direct impact on the finished product. What is frame rate? An opportunity to use the tools at your disposal to tell more immersive and memorable visual stories.

G_0M_GHw9GI,Roger Deakins and the Art of Practical Lighting — Cinematography Techniques Ep. 3,2021-01-25 12:00:09+00:00,"Roger Deakins explains his favorite practical lighting techniques in film.

00:41 - What is Practical Lighting?
01:49 - Start with Blocking
02:51 - Find Your Source
04:03 - Natural Lighting

Cinematographer Roger Deakins is no stranger to practical lighting. In this video essay, Deakins explains his approach to practical lighting and why it isn’t just about convenience, it’s about the storytelling. As the cinematographer for such gorgeously lit movies as The Shawshank Redemption, The Village, and Sicario, Deakins knows a thing or two about practical lighting.

Using practical lighting in film has two direct and positive effects. First, practical lighting establishes a motivation for the light in your scene. This doesn’t always need to happen but it helps create the verisimilitude of the scene. As Roger Deakins explains, unmotivated lighting personally takes him out of a movie. Practical lighting, in other words, helps create a cohesive and immersive experience.

The second benefit of practical lighting in film is literally practical. Without practical lights, the entire lighting setup would need to be adjusted for each shot in a scene. And if you’re up to speed on your cliche Hollywood lingo, “time is money.” Lighting with practicals helps reduce that extra time and allows the filmmakers to work within the space more fluidly and effectively. 

Roger Deakins cinematography doesn’t just look good, it’s also often minimal and motivated. You can see this even in hyper-stylized worlds like Blade Runner 2049 and In Time. Consider building practical lighting directly into your next project and see for yourself just how it can help tell better stories.

1I6LdJW3Xyk,Road to Perdition — How Sam Mendes Tells a Complete Story in ONE Shot,2021-01-11 12:00:01+00:00,"In Road to Perdition, director Sam Mendes uses simple camera movement and a rack focus to capture one of the film’s key moments.

3:44  How Conner is Presented
4:44  Floorplan & Recap

Road to Perdition is an underrated gangster film from director Sam Mendes. The film is shot with gorgeous and stunning cinematography from the late great Conrad L. Hall. But there is one shot in particular that packs a punch. In this video essay, we’re going to look at how a single shot can light the spark for the entire film. 

Road to Perdition is about an Irish mob family in the Midwest led by John Rooney (Paul Newman). Rooney’s right-hand man is Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), which makes Rooney’s son, Connor (Daniel Craig), boil under his skin. This jealousy reaches a tipping point at the end of Act One — which is where we’ll focus our film analysis.

Connor has just been scolded by Rooney in front of the organization’s leadership. And as Rooney leaves the table, his arm around Sullivan, Connor finally cracks. The camera slowly pushes toward Connor in shallow focus, which at this point is nothing special. But the then shallow depth of field leaves Connor and follows Rooney and Sullivan behind him, leaving Connor in the frame but out of focus. 

Then, just as Rooney and Sullivan exit the frame, we get a rack focus back to Connor in close-up. His cold and chillingly empty eyes tell us everything. Connor has reached his breaking point and he has been ignored for the last time.

This is how Sam Mendes and Conrad L. Hall have shown us Connor twice before — out of focus, ignored, passed over. So, it’s not just a one-off technique...suddenly, this is much more...a motif! With such a simple moment, Sam Mendes gives an elegant lesson in visual storytelling. Instead of cutting between multiple shots, we get one smooth and slow movement forward and a rack focus that puts us into Connor’s head. This is just one shot from Road to Perdition but it just might be the most important shot in the entire film.

0txdzPfC-Ow,How to Write a Screenplay that's a Crowd-Pleaser — Back to the Future & the Flat Character Arc,2021-01-04 11:45:00+00:00,"How ""Back to the Future"" includes a lead character who manages to achieve his wants and needs without having an actual character arc. This is episode 1 of ""The Four Endings.""

10:47 Final Takeaways

There is a reason why Back to the Future became such an iconic film — it started with an immaculately constructed screenplay. Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale somehow managed to give their protagonist, Marty McFly, both his wants and needs without a traditional character arc. How is this even possible? In this first episode of a mini-series on how to write a screenplay ending, we’re hopping into the DeLorean and punching it up to 88mph.

There are only 4 ways to end a movie and each comes down to whether or not the hero gets their wants and/or needs. First, let’s talk about wants. When writing a screenplay, a “want” is something external and specific to the protagonist that drives the plot forward. In Back to the Future, Marty’s initial want to be a rockstar but that all changes with the introduction of Doc Brown’s DeLorean time machine. Once he’s stranded 30 years in the past, Marty McFly unwittingly disrupts his own family history and, therefore, creates a new want — to get his parents to fall in love. 

Needs are something internal in the character but universal to us all and something that drives their character arc. But in Back to the Future, Marty doesn’t really have a traditional character arc. He has what KM Weiland describes as a “flat character arc” in which the protagonist doesn’t personally change but becomes the catalyst for change in the characters around them. Therefore, the “need” is mostly attributed to Marty’s father, George McFly. George needs to stand up for himself and be confident. 

Here’s where it gets interesting — Marty’s need is to overcome his fear of becoming a “slacker” like his father. So, as Marty pushes George to become a stronger and more assertive character, he is also working towards his own need simultaneously. In the end, Marty gets his want and need, culminating in what we’re calling the “Sweet” ending.

In the next 3 episodes, we’ll cover how to write a screenplay using one of the remaining options (“Semi-Sweet,” “Bittersweet,” and “Bitter”).

In this video essay, we’re going to talk about...video essays. As we close the book on 2020, we thought we’d take this opportunity to review our best movie video essays (by popularity).

This 2020 Recap video marks StudioBinder’s 50th original video essay of the year. Along the way, we tackled a variety of topics, genres, techniques, and styles. We tackled power dynamics in The Godfather and how simple blocking and staging could swing that power back and forth between characters. We broke down the tension Quentin Tarantino brought to the table for Cliff Booth’s long walk in Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood. We were given a real treat when director Jay Roach stopped by the office to explain how he directed the action-packed intro in Austin Powers in Goldmember. 

As part of our ongoing Directing Styles video essays, this time we dissected the multilayered ambiguity running through the work of Denis Villeneuve. We also launched a new series entitled The Shot List with an episode dedicated to the various shot sizes and their storytelling values. The stellar soundtracks of Tarantino became one of our favorite video essay subjects. As did our exploration of a technological development that more and more filmmakers are pursuing — the 2:1 aspect ratio.

Another episode of Directing Styles was dedicated to Stanley Kubrick and his enigmatic and formidable films. And then we turned our attention to another visual stylist, Wes Anderson, and his juxtaposition of bright colors and dark subjects. Episode 6 of The Shot List, focusing on camera movement, proved to be a challenge and a joy to produce. We finished out the year with a Save the Cat Beat Sheet breakdown of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar and an episode of Directing Styles on the emotional connections Paul Thomas Anderson gives us to his characters.

The StudioBinder community on YouTube has been extremely supportive and positive — which is good because we love what we do. Thank you to everyone who tuned in and we can’t wait to show you what we have in store for 2021.

Paul Thomas Anderson is a singular filmmaker with a voice that feels familiar and wholly original at the same time. His passion for film and filmmaking is visible on-screen and his constant evolution is something most of us are still trying to wrap our heads around. In this episode of our Directing Styles series, we turn to the first four features in Paul Thomas Anderson’s career. Naturally, we’ll cover his later work in Part Two. 

Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and Punch-Drunk Love — if PT Anderson’s career had ended there, we would still have a lot to talk about. But what can we learn from the way Anderson directed these movies? This is our humble attempt to understand Paul Thomas Anderson movies by looking at them through the seven main elements of film directing. 

If we look at the stories he’s telling, Paul Thomas Anderson is clearly interested in the family, in all shapes and forms. From broken homes to surrogate families, and from nagging sisters to finding true love. If we consider Anderson’s production design, we also find a pattern in how he uses domestic spaces (homes, apartments, motel rooms, etc.) as the natural environment for these stories and characters. Think about the interior of Eddie’s bedroom in Boogie Nights, how his walls are adorned with not just “typical teenager stuff,” but with very specific content that illustrates Eddie’s backstory without a single word of dialogue.

Nobody uses a moving camera quite like Paul Thomas Anderson, from the subtle adjustments to the extreme push-ins. But these aren’t flashy techniques for their own sake — they’re always in service of the character and their particular emotions. In Magnolia, on an extremely awkward date, Jim and Claudia kiss as the camera rushes in to match the adrenaline Jim must be feeling at that moment. PT Anderson certainly has his fair share of heavily-edited moments but it is his long takes that are truly special. Again, he’s not trying to show off, it’s just that to cut away from a character in a moment of emotional catharsis would be to deny them that release. 

Music plays a huge role in Paul Thomas Anderson movies, both in their integration with the plot but in how entire sequences are presented. Look no further than the clicks, pops, scratches, and chaos on the soundtrack in Punch-Drunk Love. As Barry flails in his anxiety, Anderson puts us in the same exact and literal headspace as Barry. But then it smooths out completely when Barry finds love and we are transported into something like a classic musical.

So, what can we learn from Paul Thomas Anderson movies? Much more than we can cover in this video. When it comes to filmmaking and especially directing, we have in PT Anderson a wealth of inspiration that we can return to often and still find something new.

04:39 Deviating from 180 Rule
05:01 Slow Shutter Speeds
07:33 Fast Shutter Speeds
09:10 Final Takeaways

Shutter speed is an integral aspect of shooting any photo or video. Along with the other two camera settings that make up the exposure triangle, aperture, and ISO, shutter speed is something you need to understand. In this cinematography and photography tutorial, we will continue our Exposure Triangle series with a look at the pivotal role of the camera shutter. Included are topics on shutter speed, the difference between shutter angle vs shutter speed, motion blur, and how all of the effects of these settings are wanted or unwanted depending on your vision.

This is shutter speed explained.

The camera shutter is a moveable barrier that blocks light from hitting the camera’s sensor or film until the desired moment. As the film passes through, the shutter remains open for a specific amount of time, which is typically only fractions of a second. In both photography and cinematography, the role of shutter speed is two-fold: to regulate the amount of exposure to the light and the amount of motion blur. Along with frame rate, shutter speed can be decreased to allow more blurring in the image, or increased to eliminate motion blur altogether. To create cinematic video, for example, there is something called the 180 degree shutter rule, which states that the shutter speed should be double your frame rate. So, if you’re shooting 24fps, your shutter speed would be 1/48th of a second. This is because that’s what motion pictures have been using for decades and this ratio will give you the perfect level of motion blur needed for cinematic video.

We’ll also cover shutter angle vs shutter speed, which is a bit of a misnomer because they are really the same thing, just measured differently. Shutter speed is measured in time and shutter angle is measured in degrees, which is typically reserved for shooting video rather than photography. 

Another common topic covered in this shutter speed tutorial is rolling shutter vs global shutter. The names for each type are a little misleading because this involves the camera’s sensor rather than the mechanical camera shutter. It is important to understand what type your camera has because it will determine how you should be capturing images. 

When you’ve grasped shutter speed, motion blur, shutter angle, the 180 degree shutter rule, and similar camera settings, you’ll be that much closer to mastering the art of image-making.

Edgar Wright has only directed 6 feature films. Take a moment to let that sink in. A Fistful of Fingers, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, The World’s End, Baby Driver — each an instant classic in their respective genres. Few filmmakers have been able to create such an impression so quickly and this is not an accident. In this video, our latest installment in The Director’s Chair series, we’ve collected Edgar Wright interviews from throughout his career that collectively explain his filmmaking process.
 
Long before his beloved Cornetto Trilogy, Edgar Wright movies exhibited a unique visual comedy with his trademark ""Edgar Wright Transitions"" (aka quick cuts), and a sophisticated approach to flipping genres at the writing stage. Even his short films like A Fistful of Fingers have that “Edgar Wright directing style” written all over them. In his screenwriting, Edgar Wright is openly drawn to genre films, and, as he explains, the formulas they provide become road maps to creativity. Consider the effortless blend of the zombie and romantic comedy subgenres in Shaun of the Dead, or the glowing homage to action films in Hot Fuzz. 

Music is also a major element in Edgar Wright movies. In Baby Driver, he wrote the screenplay with specific songs in mind with the plan to edit the scenes to match the music. In fact, he reveals that they created a feature-length animatic, timed to the beat, before shooting even began. But again, this is nothing new — you’ll recall the thrilling execution of the barkeep beatdown set to Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” in Shaun of the Dead.

In these Edgar Wright interviews, it becomes immediately apparent that this is a filmmaker in love with his medium. With his visual comedy, trademark ""Edgar Wright transitions"" (quick cuts), detailed screenwriting methods, and precise storyboarding, Wright is in complete control of his filmmaking. And this gives us, the audience, the ability to just sit back and watch a master at work.

Midsommar (2019), written and directed by Ari Aster, is a horror film that absolutely rewards repeat viewing. If you can handle this daylight nightmare a second (or third) time, you will see things you never saw the first time. In fact, once you start paying attention to the background, you’ll realize that Midsommar is actually working on multiple levels to keep you spooked, unnerved, and anxious. In this video essay, we investigate the ways in which Ari Aster hides secrets, clues, easter eggs, and foreshadowing right in front of you. 

This is Midsommar Explained.

First of all, Midsommar is a horror movie shot in almost complete daylight and wide-open exteriors. So, how is it possible to make anything scary? Don’t we need darkness and enclosed spaces to keep the audience tense? Hereditary, Ari Aster’s previous film, certainly knew those rules and followed them to a “T.” This is the first clue — Ari Aster knows that these are our expectations and he uses them against us. When we have a shadowy and suspenseful scene, the audience leans in, their eyes scanning the frame to spot the monster that must certainly be there. 

But in Midsommar we have no reason to suspect anything nefarious, nothing lurking the dark, which is how Ari Aster is able to “hide” many elements in the background without us knowing. And yet, once you do see what’s happening in the background, you realize where the tension you felt throughout Midsommar came from. What we assume are extras performing innocent or menial tasks are actually preparing for the gruesome and ritualistic fates soon to befall our protagonists. 

So, what are we supposed to take away from this Midsommar analysis? Use the background to your full advantage — don’t just hire random extras to fill the space, give them something to do that works to ramp up tension or keep us guessing. This is how Ari Aster creates a sense of claustrophobia when there is abundance of space and tension when we have little reason to be tense. Even if you aren’t going to shoot a folk horror movie in broad daylight, the lesson still stands: use every part of your frame, even when you know we won’t be looking.

Tim Burton is a visionary director in every sense of the word. Watching Tim Burton movies, like Sleepy Hollow, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, and Alice in Wonderland, the first thing you notice is that every square inch of the frame is bursting with his personality and his sensibilities. In this video essay, as part of our mise en scene series, we’re going to take a guided tour through the work of Tim Burton. Specifically, his production design, set design, and art direction, which have remained consistently “Burtonesque” for the last 4 decades.

The term “world-building” gets thrown around a lot but in Tim Burton’s case, it’s quite literal. In fact, Burton often builds two worlds in each film — what we’ll call hyperreal suburbia and the macabre otherworld. In movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and Big Fish, the real world collides with the fantasy world in juxtapositions that enhance the power of each. In Edward Scissorhands, consider the design of Edward’s ramshackle and neglected attic space against Kim’s bright and wholesome bedroom. Two characters from two vastly different worlds, making their eventual connection that much stronger.

Every director has their influences but few filmmakers pay homage to them quite like Tim Burton, The most recognizable influence is German Expressionism, which manifests in angles lines and exaggerated architecture — think of the graveyard in Frankenweenie. We can see Burton’s love of monster movies and the animation style of Ray Harryhausen. There’s also the throwback ‘60s science-fiction aesthetic all over Mars Attacks! And we can’t forget the cookie-cutter wholesomeness of his suburbs, directly referencing his own childhood in the domestic utopia of Burbank, California. 

From a production design, set design, and art direction perspective, the mise en scene in Tim Burton movies is second to none. The whimsical and the macabre, the extra plain and the exaggerated, the ghoulish and the fantastic — Tim Burton is a true world-builder.

The camera lens is an essential consideration in photography and cinematography. Camera lenses are on the front line of how an image is captured but not all are created equal. In this episode of The Shot List, we’ll walk through the gamut of camera lenses to differentiate both their inherent qualities and how they each tell a different story.

Let’s begin by making an important distinction between a zoom lens vs prime lens. Within each of these categories can be a variety of camera lenses but what separates them has to do with focal length. A prime lens has a fixed focal length while a zoom lens can operate through a range of focal lengths. There are pros and cons within the zoom lens vs prime lens debate, which we will cover in detail in the video.

The different types of camera lenses are mostly divided into categories based on their focal length, measured in millimeters. Focal length is the distance between the back of the lens and the image plane — the shorter the distance, the wider the field of view. For example, extreme wide angle lenses and fisheye lenses capture the widest field of view. The field of view with a telephoto lens is much more narrow but, in exchange, you can photograph subjects at a greater distance. 

A standard lens is any lens where the focal length matches the size of the camera’s sensor. This gives the image a “natural” look that best approximates human vision. A macro lens is designed to capture subjects in extremely close proximity. Whereas most camera lenses align their elements perpendicularly to the image plane, a tilt-shift lens has a unique function that can “tilt” or “shift” that alignment. This leads to both subtle and extreme distortions. 

Each of these camera lenses has unique properties that shape the look and texture of the image. As you work through your shot list, keep these options in mind and you’ll be that much closer to realizing your vision.

03:14 - Epilogue Montage

07:51 - Final Takeaways

From the very beginning, Christopher Nolan has changed the way we watch movies. From his experiments with non-linear timelines to his high-concept plots, Nolan brings something new to the table every time out. The same can be said for how he uses a rather tired cinematic trope: the movie montage. In this video essay, we’ll explore the inspired and creative ways Christopher Nolan takes the film language of a movie montage and elevates it beyond cliche.

When we think of a movie montage, what comes to mind? The typical training montage perhaps best associated with Rocky has been parroted and parodied endlessly (e.g., Team America: World Police). And, yet, somehow Christopher Nolan was able to bring legitimacy back to the movie montage — look no further than the Batman training montage in Batman Begins. The first way Christopher Nolan subverts the typical training montage is to place it in the middle of Act One. In this case, Bruce Wayne isn’t just training to fight the big, bad villain, we are given exposition, backstory, and the beginnings of his entire character arc.

Beyond elevating the training montage, Christopher Nolan also uses the movie montage to end his movies. In movies like Dunkirk, Interstellar, The Dark Knight Rises and The Prestige, Nolan gives us something like a “movie montage epilogue.” More than simply tying up loose ends, Nolan gives us a glimpse of the past, present and future. In the case of Dunkirk, he is able to use voice over to create a “thematic montage,” where the virtues and bravery of that particularly harrowing situation are honored and cherished in montage.

The final way Christopher Nolan reinvents the movie montage is to concentrate emotional catharsis. The best example of this comes from Interstellar as we watch Cooper watch a series of video messages sent from his children during the decades he’s been gone. The movie montage is often used to accelerate time but, in this case, he’s accelerating emotion.

In short, Christopher Nolan shows us that the movie montage is more than just a laughable trope — it can be wielded in fresh and exciting ways. Whether you take a training montage and use it to establish character, construct thematic and resonant endings, or amplify the emotions of your characters, a movie montage just might be the best way to do it.

Interstellar (2014) changed the science fiction game. Beyond the never-before-seen specific effects, it was the screenplay by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan that helped make it such an outstanding movie. Interstellar is a complex and highly imaginative story that does require some explanation, especially the Interstellar ending, which is why we’re here. This is the Interstellar Ending Explained with the help of Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat Beat sheet.

In order to completely grasp the impact and depth of the Interstellar ending, we have to go back to the beginning. We find Cooper, our protagonist, and his precocious daughter, Murph experiencing some strange phenomena, which she thinks of as “her ghost.” Meanwhile, the Earth is experiencing a devastating global environmental crisis and NASA enlists Cooper to lead a mission to find a new home planet. 

Cooper and the Endurance crew literally go interstellar in hopes of finding salvation with the thematic conflict of Interstellar posed: will Cooper’s faith in science alone be enough to save the human race, or will he have to expand his beliefs to embrace the unknown?

Blake Snyder’s groundbreaking Save the Cat beat sheet is a system that maps out a complete character arc. We’ve seen plenty of sci-fi “men on a mission” stories before but there’s something about Interstellar that feels entirely different. There are a lot of story beats in Interstellar that match traditional story structure but the way Jonathan and Christopher Nolan are able to weave themes of love and sacrifice within a story full of scientific theory is nothing short of amazing. With the Interstellar ending explained, we can see just how layered and powerful the entire screenplay is, starting on page one.

00:51 Chapter 1: Learn Your Film Lights
01:54 Chapter 2: Lighting the Night
03:04 Chapter 3: Mix Your Lights
04:50 Chapter 4: Lighting Faces

Roger Deakins returns with part two of his discussion on “learning to light.” In the previous episode of Cinematography Techniques, Roger Deakins walked us through the fundamentals of how to observe light and how still photography became a major inspiration. This time, we’ll get a little more practical as Deakins touches on night shooting, lighting the human face, the subtle art of mixing light in a shot, and knowing which light is best for the job.

In Chapter One, Deakins stresses the importance of knowing the different light available and their characteristics. In this case, he mentions using a skypan in Blade Runner 2049 to create sharp, moving shadows in the scenes at Wallace Corp. The next chapter centers on shooting nighttime scenes that actually look like night — compared to scenes where a pronounced blue or green tint is added to simulate moonlight.  If you’ve seen his work, you know that a big part of Roger Deakins’ cinematography is working in the shadows. 

Roger Deakins admits one of his “biggest conundrums” is mixing light. From his schooling, he was always taught to match his color sources — a holdover “rule” from the Technicolor days. Deakins mentions a scene from True Grit where he lit a campfire scene by mixing firelight with the moonlight, as opposed to previous Western cinematography techniques that kept a more uniform light in every scene. 

Finally, Deakins talks about a fundamental technique in photography and cinematography — lighting the human face. He quotes a fashion photographer who said, “If you can photograph a human face, you can photograph anything.” It’s more than simply adding light to the face, it’s about how you angle, diffuse, and create contrast with the light to brings out that person’s character. There’s a lot more to learn from cinematographer Roger Deakins that we’ll explore in future episodes. Stay tuned for the next episode of Cinematography Techniques.

What is ISO? Camera ISO is just one of three camera settings that make up the exposure triangle. In photography and cinematography, the exposure triangle is how image makers can adjust to any lighting scenario. In this episode of our aperture, shutter speed and ISO tutorial series, we look at camera ISO and its essential role in exposure. This is ISO explained.

ISO (pronounced “eye-so”) is the name adopted by the International Organization for Standardization. This group, which has been around for decades, is a global organization dedicated to creating international standards for everything from medical devices to country codes. One of their first ISO standards was for the “light sensitivity” of black and white celluloid film. Since then, the term ISO in photography and cinematography has stuck and refers to how sensitive unexposed film (or a camera’s sensor) is to incoming light.

In this ISO guide, we’ll explain the various “ISO speeds” or camera ISO settings with a practical photography tutorial on when these choices should be made. Which ISO to use in low light settings or overly bright scenarios? It all depends on the other camera settings like aperture and shutter speed — and what your ultimate goal for the shot is.

A high ISO setting pushes the camera sensor to be more sensitive to light, while a low ISO setting desensitizes it. Naturally, when you’re shooting a bright exterior scene, you would need your camera ISO to be less sensitive. Vice versa, in a low light scenario, you might be tempted to raise your ISO speed. But be careful — a high ISO setting can also introduce film grain or digital noise into your image.  

Another consideration when choosing your camera ISO speed is dynamic range. Dynamic range dictates how bright and dark an image can be while still retaining visual information. For example, if you’re shooting a bright sky above a dark forest, you might not be able to capture complete detail in both areas. These days, digital cameras have what’s called a native ISO setting where the optimal dynamic range is found. 

With these ISO settings, your photography or cinematography can be versatile and nuanced. Remember, ISO is just one of the camera basics included in the exposure triangle. Make sure to watch the other photography tutorial videos in this series to get the complete picture.

Roger Deakins cinematography is as stunning as ever. What he pulled off in 1917 is just the latest exemplar of cinematic lighting and camera movement from a career defined by it. In this video essay, we’re doing something a little different — instead of us fawning over Roger Deakins like the cinematography messiah that he is, we’re going to let him speak for himself. 

Using Deakins own words from his incredible Team Deakins podcast, we get to sit back and let him talk us through his approach to cinematography, lighting, and his inspirations. Roger Deakins discusses how fishing as a child allowed him the opportunity to observe nature and how light plays in the natural world. How the work of still photography from the likes of William Eggleston and Brassaï got him focused on the details of an image. 

Roger Deakins cinematography techniques are based on simplicity. He recalls a quote from another famed cinematographer, James Wong Howe, about Howe’s ultimate goal was to find a way to execute cinematic lighting with a single light. And when you look at Roger Deakins’ work, you can see his dedication to simplicity and the love he has for image making. In films like Skyfall, Blade Runner 2049, Sicario, No Country for Old Men, and The Shawshank Redemption, Roger Deakins has inspired an entire generation of his own.

Camera movement is a surefire way to amplify your visual storytelling. Whether you opt for a dolly shot, a tracking shot, or decide to go handheld, a simple scene can turn into an electrifying moment. In this video essay, Episode 6 of The Shot List, we’re going to cover every type of camera movement in film. From the storytelling value of each camera movement to the camera movement techniques necessary to pull them off.

First up is the static shot — the absence of camera movement. Static shots are perfect for dialogue scenes or when you want to showcase the actor’s performance. A pan shot is a go-to when you want to reveal context, setting, or even build suspense. A whip pan can be a dynamic way to transition between characters in a scene or between different scenes. The tilt is a camera movement typically used to introduce characters or show the size and scope of a location. 

Pushing the camera in or pulling out are camera movements designed to either connect or disconnect the audience to a character or a situation. A zoom shot is not technically a camera movement because it is a function of the lens magnifying or de-magnifying the image. But when you combine it with a dolly camera movement, you can create a striking and cinematic camera movement called a dolly zoom. The dolly zoom effect compresses or stretches the background around the subject for an evocative and powerful camera shot. When a camera rolls, the world is literally turned upside down. 

Tracking shots will lead or follow the subject and can be utilized in any number of situations. When the camera follows parallel to the subject, it is known as trucking. When the camera movement surrounds the subject to make them feel surrounded or perhaps heroic, you’ve got yourself an arc shot. A boom shot is a vertical camera movement, which can be subtle or grand like a crane shot. The final camera movement is handheld with random shake and/or seemingly arbitrary zooms. When you’re going for documentary realism, this is the ideal approach to camera movement.

The Coen Brothers are two directors with one vision. Perhaps working as a pair helps them cover such a wide range of subjects — from Looney Tunes-style comedies to bleak, fatalistic thrillers. And they seem to operate within these disparate modes with equal prowess and control. There are few filmmakers with such a definitive style and we’re here to see if we can decode the Coen Brothers cinematic DNA. Using seven areas of focus, including cinematography, sound design, and editing, we’ll work through their filmography to isolate how each piece of the puzzle fits together.

The Coen Brothers love a good idiot and they revel in watching them try to cheat the system. We can find these dimwit desperados in Coen Brothers movies like Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Ladykillers, and Burn After Reading. Coupled with their insanely tight and pitch-perfect dialogue, Joel and Ethan Coen also use production design to make each character (from the leads to the bit parts) completely unique. Think of any character in The Big Lebowski, for example — the diversity of their personalities is matched by their costume choices. In other words, the Coen Brothers populate their movies with fully realized individuals giving the overall film depth and a tone that can only be described as Coen-esque. Between their two main modes (dark comedy and thriller), the Coen Brothers use color as a way to negotiate tone. For comedies, the colors are often bright and saturated; for thrillers, the opposite — desaturated and monotone. 

In their cinematography, the Coen Brothers again use lighting to direct or contrast the genre they are working in. Sometimes, and this is when it gets the most interesting, they counter our expectations altogether. In movies like The Big Lebowski and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, we might see dramatic, chiaroscuro lighting for comedic scenes and flat, even lighting for suspenseful moments. In their editing, comedies are typically edited around the rhythms created by their dialogue, but in thrillers like No Country for Old Men, it is the silent moments that are presented with Hitchcockian tension.

Sound design in the Coen Brothers’ movies also ping pongs between almost cartoonish effects to dramatic silence, dripping with suspense. 
Barton Fink finds the Coen Brothers soundtracking the Hotel Earle as if it were some haunted, existential labyrinth. And in The Hudsucker Proxy, the film’s screwball-throwback mise-en-scene is complemented with light and playful sound design. Music is one of the Coen Brothers’ director trademarks and each film has a distinct world-building score. Think of the Southern bluegrass of O Brother, Where Art Thou? or the menagerie of folk music at the core of Inside Llewyn Davis. One could argue that the Coen Brothers approach their music choices with the same amount of thoughtfulness and purpose as anything else in their directing style.

08:31 Next Ep: The Mise-en-Scene of Tim Burton

Mise en scene includes a number of different elements but perhaps none have such a direct and powerful impact on the overall effect of a shot than color. Color in film is an essential tool in visual storytelling and if there’s one filmmaker who understands this, it’s Stanley Kubrick. 2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining are all visual feasts with color becoming the main course. 

In this video essay, we’ll traverse Stanley Kubrick’s color palette across the color wheel. Once you see how much attention Kubrick gives to the colors in his mise en scene, you’ll see that the role it plays cannot be understated. Think of the overwhelming green in Full Metal Jacket, or the yellow Christmas lights in Eyes Wide Shut, or even the pronounced reds in Barry Lyndon. It becomes clear that each film’s color palette plays a huge role in the overall mise en scene.

In visual storytelling and mise en scene, we can find color in four distinct areas: sets & locations, props, costume/hair/makeup, and lighting. In Stanley Kubrick movies, we can find the entire color wheel represented in each of those elements of mise en scene. As you approach color theory and color psychology in your own work, remember the lessons of filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick. 

There’s a reason we’re still obsessing over Stanley Kubrick movies decades later — his control of mise en scene, especially color palettes, is without equal.

What is mise-en-scène? If you went to film school, or even casually studied film theory, you’ve heard this term many times. But what does it mean and why is it so important? In this video essay, you’ll learn everything you need to know about mise-en-scène — from its origins in theater, how film theorists like Andre Bazin championed it, and how filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick applied it to his work.

In French, mise-en-scène literally means “placing on stage,” or the process of how theater directors would decide what should go on the stage and how those elements should be arranged. This same concept was easily borrowed by film directors — everything you see on-screen is part of the “mise-en-scéne.” 

This includes elements that fall under the umbrella term of production design (props, wardrobe, set design, movie props, etc.) as well as cinematography (cinematic lighting, frame rate, depth of field, camera framing, composition). In addition, the blocking and staging of the camera and actors, their performance, and even what we hear on the soundtrack (film music, sound design) counts as mise-en-scéne. 

In film directing, it is the task of the director to decide how all of these elements will be placed, arranged, and combined in each shot. When you look at the work of filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick, you start to see the method behind each of these elements — even if you can’t fully understand WHY, the overall effect is seen and felt. Visual storytelling is all about using each image to tell the story. When filmmakers are in control of visual storytelling (of mise-en-scene), they can create powerful and layered images that we study in videos like this for decades.

Wes Anderson — a filmmaker with a completely distinct visual style (aka the ""Wes Anderson Style""), and a director with an eye for color psychology. In fact, of all his director trademarks found in films like Rushmore, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and Fantastic Mr. Fox, it is his color palette that invites the most praise and analysis. In this video essay, we’ll take a specific look at how Wes Anderson often uses a bright and saturated color palette to balance out the darker subject matter of his films. 

Color theory (or color psychology) suggests that certain colors have particular characteristics in how we relate to them. The color wheel, in other words, might represent the gamut of all human emotions. In Wes Anderson movies, he doesn’t typically favor one color over another — but he does use color palettes that pop on screen. 

In movies like The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited, the production design is a feast of colors. But considering the subject matter of those films (dysfunctional families, revenge, death), the color palettes don’t quite fit. And that’s the interesting part of the Wes Anderson style — the tone is balanced with contrasting color schemes.

With such bright and saturated fairy tale color palettes, Wes Anderson movies can touch on deep, existential issues without bumming people out. And if it weren’t for the dramatic content, the exaggerated colors would be unbearably optimistic and cheerful. In standard film theory, color in film is usually seen to “support” the tone of the subject matter, but Wes Anderson movies complicate those expectations. This is advanced color theory executed by a filmmaker with a complete grasp of the color wheel who challenges our predisposed notions of color in film.

Camera rigs come in all shapes and sizes...and all budgets. Camera gear is expensive and camera setup can eat up a lot of time on set. In other words, if you’re going to invest the time and money in a camera rig, you should know the camera gear options available and how they work. In this episode of the Shot List, our focus is the various camera rigs and film equipment that will provide both production value and storytelling value to your next project.

To give a shot either intimacy or intensity, handheld camera rigs like a shoulder rig or easy rig work best. For maximum stability and stillness, you can’t go wrong with a tripod. When the camera needs to move smoothly, there are a number of camera rigs that are up to the task. A camera dolly is ideal but a camera slider is another lower-cost option. Everyone has heard of Steadicam camera stabilizers but, again, you might not have the budget for it. In that case, a gimbal stabilizer is an effective and affordable option. The debate between Steadicam vs gimbal really just comes down to budget. 

For large or complicated camera movements, a camera crane is great for vertical movements to establish landscapes or top-down shots. If a camera crane is too costly or if your location can’t fit massive film equipment, camera jibs or an overhead camera setup work just fine. Let’s say the shot requires extremely precise camera movements? If you can afford one, a motion control camera system (aka camera robot) can pull off shots that are literally inhuman. A Snorricam is an ideal camera rig to capture an extremely subjective point of view, great for extreme emotional states or characters under the influence.

Finally, camera rigs that are used anytime vehicles are involved — anything from a car mount to strapping a camera to the side of an airplane. Aerial cinematography has never been easier or more affordable now that drone cameras have changed the game. Underwater cameras are obviously essential for anything in or around water. 

No matter the scene, there is an ideal camera rig perfectly suited to capture your vision. Camera gear is changing all the time, opening up the possibilities even further. Image makers like Peter McKinnon, Matti Haapoja, Potato Jet, and Peter Lindgren understand how important camera gear is. Like all great artists, you need to master the tools before you can master the work.

07:35 Learn more about aperture

What is aperture? An aperture is what determines how much light passes through a camera’s lens. In photography and filmmaking, lens aperture is more than just an anonymous mechanism inside a lens. The aperture setting is the principal element used to manipulate depth of field, focal length, bokeh, and more. Lens aperture, along with ISO and shutter speed, is also part of the exposure triangle, which dictates the exposure of the final image. In other words, the aperture isn’t just necessary to capture images, it has a direct effect on the look and feel of those images. This is aperture explained, Part 1 of our series on the exposure triangle.

In this video essay and aperture tutorial, we will cover everything you need to know about aperture, depth of field, exposure, f stops, and t stops in photography and filmmaking. Once we cover the basic mechanics of how aperture works, we’ll look at how aperture settings create depth of field and the various visual storytelling techniques you can use in your next project.

So, what are the visual storytelling techniques associated with aperture and depth of field? In 1917, cinematographer Roger Deakins used a small aperture setting (high f stop) to achieve a deep depth of field. By doing so, we are able to observe the soldiers within their surroundings with equal clarity. In Joker, cinematographer Lawrence Sher utilizes a large aperture setting (low f stop) to create a shallow depth of field. This creates separation between Arthur and his environment, allowing us to register his emotional detachment.

In photography and filmmaking, each image-maker needs to be equally adept at aesthetics and mechanics. You won’t be able to speak the language of visual storytelling if you don’t know how to manipulate tools like aperture. Depth of field, focal length, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, and aperture are elements that work in combination to create an image. When you understand the role each of those elements plays, you’ll be one step closer to becoming a master visual artist.

The dinner scene — sometimes considered the least cinematic and yet most common scene in many movies. Two characters sitting, eating, and talking can be found everywhere in cinema. From every decade and every genre, the eating scene is almost always about something other than the food. We’ve seen these scenes countless times but only a few are memorable. So, how do the best dinner scenes in movies give these obligatory moments life and personality?

In this video essay, our focus is how directors can use production design and set design, blocking and staging, and cinematography to craft cinematic dinner scenes. Consider the Hereditary dinner scene and how the blocking and framing of the characters purposefully enhance the drama. 

What are we to make of the dinner scenes from Goodfellas and Jojo Rabbit, where the abundance or lack of food on the table gives us character and story information. How about the infamous breakfast montage from Citizen Kane where the camera pulls back to reveal the literal and figurative distance between Kane and his wife?

We can find one of the most awkward dinner scenes in Manchester by the Sea. As Patrick dines with his estranged mother and her new husband, the disconnect between them is all captured in the framing. As you start storyboarding your next dinner scene, remember to keep these considerations in mind — who is where, what is there, and what’s being shared. Because the best dinner scenes are rarely, if ever, about dinner.

Stanley Kubrick will go down as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. No question. But why? What makes his filmmaking so outstanding? In this video essay, our task (and not an easy one) will be to dig inside Stanley Kubrick’s directing style to see if we can unlock the secrets within. From his scriptwriting, production design, color, cinematography, film editing, sound design, and film music — his mastery of all these filmmaking elements is legendary.

Stanley Kubrick only made 13 movies in his lifetime, but they are all considered classics. Not only the best movies in their respective genres but also some of the best movies ever made. Dr Strangelove, 2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut, just a few iconic Stanley Kubrick movies you may have heard of. Despite their dissimilarities, behind each is filmmaking craftsmanship at its finest.

With regards to Kubrick’s scriptwriting, his consistent focus is the human experience, where big questions are left unanswered. In his production design, he will echo the prevailing themes of each film into the set design and costumes. Stanley Kubrick is often associated with his cinematography, including his wide shot compositions, practical lighting, and those iconic tracking shots. Any fan of color theory will have a field day with Kubrick’s colors, which sail past subtle and overwhelm us.

Kubrick doesn’t overly cut his films — his film editing is reserved and patient. On the soundtrack, Stanley Kubrick might go light on sound design but more than compensates with dramatic and enthralling film music.

In the world of film theory and film analysis, Stanley Kubrick has left us 13 amazing films that we will endlessly puzzle over, dissect, and interpret. In film directing, he has set the bar for directors everywhere. And while we never get another Stanley Kubrick movie, what he has given us will last forever.

Chapters:
00:00 Intro — Tarantino's Use of Sound & Violence
01:26 Building Tone with Sound Design
02:49 Sound Design in Kill Bill
04:05 Design with Intent
05:55 Sound Design Tips in Practice

Quentin Tarantino has been dealing in film violence for decades. Tarantino’s cinematic violence can be equally brutal and entertaining. But how is he able to shift between these two modes so easily without completely disrupting the tone of the film? The secret lies in his film sound design. When considering sound design for film, we quickly realize just how powerful it can be in shaping our experience.

In films like Django Unchained and Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino shows us how by simply altering the sound design, scenes of violence can be perceived differently. In this video essay, we’re going to look at how Foley and sound effects are used to create either cathartic and fun violence or disturbing and gritty violence. 

In Kill Bill, when The Bride battles Gogo, the general sound design is playful and borderline cartoonish. As Gogo smashes through a table, we hear sound fx of bowling pins being knocked down — this echo of Looney Tunes sound design softens the violence. In Django Unchained, when Broomhilda is being whipped, the cinematic sound design is dramatic and vicious. Two different scenes of violence guided in two directions by film sound design.

Filmmaking is often prioritized with the visuals but directors like Quentin Tarantino understand the power of sound design. We experience movies with our eyes and our ears. When you conceptualize your next project, remember the role of film sound design in your storytelling.

14:12 In the Next Ep: Camera Gear

Depth of field might be one of the last considerations filmmakers make when creating a shot list. But that doesn’t mean it should be ignored. In this video essay, we’re going to look at camera basics like depth of field and how camera focus is used in visual storytelling. With deep depth of field, shallow depth of field, soft focus, rack focus, split diopter lens, and tilt shift lens, each brings a different perspective to your shots. This is Episode 4 of The Shot List: Depth of Field Explained.

Deep depth of field allows for action in the foreground, middle ground, and background; perfect for blocking and staging chaotic scenes like the opening shot of Gravity. Shallow depth of field helps to isolate subjects and guides the viewer’s eye with purpose and meaning — it’s also a great way to get that bokeh effect. Moonlight is full of shallow depth of field cinematography, bringing an extreme level of intimacy to the Chiron’s emotional journey. Soft focus can be used in dream sequences or flashbacks to give the cinematography a nostalgic glow, like Spielberg did throughout A.I. Artificial Intelligence. 

A rack focus is a great way to use shallow depth of field to make connections between subjects without needing to cut. Often using a follow focus controller, the focus puller can achieve even the most complicated shots, like in Bong Joon-ho’s The Host. The split diopter lens is ideal when you want to isolate foreground and background subjects simultaneously. Auteurs like Brian De Palma and Quentin Tarantino use split diopter shots all the time, including some stellar examples in The Hateful Eight.

And, finally, we have the tilt shift lens. Tilt shift shots are rarely used in filmmaking because they can produce pretty radical images. In the Coen Brothers’ A Serious Man, cinematographer Roger Deakins was able to shoot the bar mitzvah scene by visualizing Danny’s marijuana-influenced perspective. 
Directing and cinematography are all about using images to tell a story. With camera focus and depth of field in your bag of tricks, there’s no limit to how much “depth” you can bring to your shot list.

Thanos is the ultimate villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But in Avengers: Infinity War, the screenwriters tried something quite radical. They made Thanos the protagonist with a complete character arc. Is Thanos really the hero in the Avengers: Infinity War script? In this video essay, we’ll use Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat beat sheet to track how Thanos becomes not only the central protagonist but a sympathetic one as well.

Wondering how to write a screenplay that keeps viewers engaged? The Save the Cat Story structure is not an exact science and there is no such thing as the perfect plot structure. But Blake Snyder and his Save the Cat beat sheet give screenwriters a road map to story structure that is typically used for heroes, not villains. Thanos’ search for the Infinity Gauntlet is what drives the Avengers Infinity War script but how can a villain be the protagonist?

Taking cues from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, not only did the screenwriters and filmmakers behind Avengers: Infinity War develop Thanos as a complete protagonist of his own story, but he's a driving force behind the entire narrative. Rather than following dozens of superheroes in various parallel storylines, they used Thanos as the centerpiece. 

The Save the Cat beat sheet has 15 steps: from the Opening Image and Theme Stated all the way through the Finale and Closing Image. And when we break down the screenplay for Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos is there for every major story beat. We don’t know if the Russo Brothers or the screenwriters used Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat beat sheet to write Avengers: Infinity War, but the script does line up in fascinating ways.

04:53 Recap — 2:1 for Your Next Project

This is Cinematic Aspect Ratios Explained — Aspect ratios in filmmaking and cinematography are not just technical jargon, there is real visual storytelling value in which aspect ratio you choose. But what is aspect ratio today? Despite TVs being designed to accommodate widescreen filmmaking, they typically default to a 16:9 aspect ratio, which often compromises the filmmaker’s original vision. Today, we’re going to look at the 2:1 or 18:9 aspect ratio, how it might just be the perfect happy medium and why filmmakers like David Fincher and Ari Aster are switching over.

Legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro first devised the 2:1 aspect ratio in the ‘90s when he saw that the future of TV sets and programming were being standardized at 16:9. Storaro figured since movies would all end up being watched on TV anyway, it might be a good idea to start shooting movies with that in mind. Storaro’s 2:1 aspect ratio, which he dubbed Univisium, never really took off. Until today.

Netflix series like House of Cards and Stranger Things have embraced the 2:1 aspect ratio. 2:1 combines the width of 2.35:1 and the height of 1.85:1, bridging the gap and providing a cinematic aspect ratio that any film can use. David Fincher brought this cinematic aspect ratio to House of Cards, the Duffer Brothers used it for Stranger Things, Ari Aster chose it for Hereditary and Midsommar, and Colin Trevorrow shot Jurassic World in 2:1.

So, now that you can answer “what is aspect ratio and why does it matter,” which aspect ratio will you choose for your next project? Will you stick with standard formats like 1.85:1 or 2.35:1, or will you find a happy medium in the 2:1 aspect ratio?

5:24 More Cinematography Techniques
5:39 Outro — What Defines Roger Deakins Cinematography?

1917 (2019) was famous before anyone ever saw it. When it was learned that director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins captured 1917 in one shot, it became one of the most anticipated movies of the year. But how did Roger Deakins pull off shooting 1917 as one giant long take? That’s what this video essay aims to do — we’ll look at 1917 behind the scenes footage and Roger Deakins cinematography techniques, including why he used the ARRI Alexa Mini LF camera. 

According to director Sam Mendes, for 1917 one shot was all he needed to create a gripping, real-time race against the clock. Roger Deakins was brought into the pre-production process early to work out camera rigs, storyboards, and just how to pull off a 1917 one shot movie. At least, that’s what it looks like. Even though the cuts are masterfully hidden, 1917 isn’t literally a one-shot movie but it certainly looks and feels like one. 

As we look at 1917 behind the scenes, we’ll look at Roger Deakins' cinematography techniques that he and Sam Mendes used to create an immersive experience. Filmmakers are always trying to find ways to bring the audience completely into the film and that’s what the 1917 filmmakers accomplished. Long takes are just the beginning of the 1917 cinematography plan — they also chose to stick with prime lenses that match the focal length of the human eye. In other words, the camera behaves and captures the events as close to how we would experience it in person. It’s no wonder that Roger Deakins won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. In filmmaking and cinematography terms, 1917 is a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that every filmmaker will be learning from for years to come.

Every filmmaker brings some fundamental film theory to their cinematography. Whether it is the shot size, camera framing, or camera angles — they all add up to give each shot meaning. In this episode of The Shot List, we will look exclusively at cinematography techniques and camera angles in filmmaking. 

Camera angles in filmmaking have certain characteristics that every filmmaker should understand. Visual storytelling is dependent on how you use the camera to tell a story. Whether you use a high angle shot, low angle shot, birds-eye-view shot, over-the-shoulder shot (OTS), or a direct overhead shot to capture a scene, that decision brings with it the concept of “perspective.” With Dutch angle shots (aka Dutch Tilt), you’re relying on cinematography techniques to bring a sense of imbalance or tension to a shot. Camera angles and techniques like these can elevate the script and the scene in ways that only visual storytelling can provide.

When filmmakers fully understand directing, cinematography, visual storytelling, and camera angles, they have the power to turn their filmmaking into something great. Check out our previous episodes from The Shot List on Camera Shots and Camera Framing. And stay tuned for the following episode on Depth of Field and Focal Length.

9:09 Final Takeaways

Quentin Tarantino doesn’t just love movies, he loves music just as much. And he proves this love of music in every one of his movie soundtracks. Think of “Stuck in the Middle With You” from Reservoir Dogs, “Girl, You’ll Be A Woman Soon” from Pulp Fiction, or “Django” from Django Unchained. There are many ways to use movie music — but Quentin Tarantino defies expectations at every turn.

In this video essay, let’s look at Quentin Tarantino takes his movie soundtracks and crafts some of the most memorable scenes in movie history. Kill Bill, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Inglourious Basterds, The Hateful Eight — each film has a distinct musical identity but you know right away that these are Quentin Tarantino movie soundtracks. He doesn’t just pick pop songs for their own sake, Tarantino finds the rhythm and soul of each track and somehow pairs it with the perfect scene. 

In fact, much of Quentin Tarantino’s movie music should not work at all — but it does. Whether it’s torturing a man to an upbeat groove, or splicing a David Bowie track over a WWII movie — Quentin Tarantino challenges his audience with his music and we love him all the more for it.

UPy375ZEp-c,Logan and the Neo-Western Explained — The Evolution of Western Movies,2020-06-15 11:00:14+00:00,"More on Neo-Westerns ►► https://bit.ly/neo-western-films
Create a script breakdown with StudioBinder ►► https://bit.ly/37x3Jxt

Logan (2017) stands as one of the best superhero movies ever made. But it also functions in a subgenre of Western movies called the Neo-Western. This new brand of Western often focuses on the clash of traditional values in the face of modern living. With movies like Hell or High Water, No Country for Old Men, Sicario, and Logan, it appears that the Neo-Western resonates with contemporary audiences. But what is a Neo-Western and what makes it different from typical Western movies?

In film theory, movie genres are constructed by expectations. These can be consolidated into categories like theme, setting, and character types. Logan (Hugh Jackman) embodies a typical Western protagonist and a reluctant hero. When we meet Old Man Logan, he is far removed from his previous life as The Wolverine. He has grown bitter, selfish, and stubborn. It is only when he meets Laura (Dafne Keen) that his sense of purpose returns. 

When you think of Westerns, the setting is what comes to mind first. With Neo-Westerns, the locations tend to remain familiar but the time period is often modern-day, or even in the future as it is in Logan. Though no longer “The Wild West,” these are still worlds populated with cowboys, criminals, and the law.

Theme is a huge part of the best Western movies — man vs. nature, good vs. evil, order vs. chaos. The Neo-Western is no different and Logan tackles some of these same themes...with a twist. Logan has lost his healing ability and the adamantium skeleton that once made him invincible is poisoning him from within. Mortality has set in and Laura’s presence gives Logan one last chance to be a hero.

KknIryWrE-0,Are the Coen Brothers Obsessed with Desks? — How to Create Themes with Motifs,2020-06-08 11:00:14+00:00,"The Best Coen Brothers Movies of All Time ►► https://bit.ly/coens-ranked

Theme, symbolism, motifs — these can be difficult concepts to wrap your head around. In filmmaking and film theory, though, they are also elements that create layers and depth in your storytelling. It goes beyond the usual shot reverse shot. The Coen Brothers understand the power of theme, symbolism and motifs, and we can see it at work throughout their career. In this video essay, we’re going to focus on just one of these visual motifs that can be found in nearly every Coen Brothers movie: desks. 

For most people, desks are simply a piece of functional furniture. But in the Coen Brothers Universe, they seem to mean something else entirely. In films like Fargo, No Country for Old Men, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, The Big Lebowski and others, desks become symbols of power. In many, many instances, the Coen Brothers gravitate towards scenes that take place across the desk. One character wants something and the person behind the desk has the power to give it to them (but usually doesn’t). These are characters looking for control over their lives but often find themselves denied by the man behind the desk.

But there is a flip side to this idea: sometimes, the man behind the desk finds themselves losing their power. For these characters, the desk becomes an illusion of power. So, how does this point to theme?

The motif of desks and the symbolism of power leads us to consider the overarching theme of not just isolated Coen Brothers movies but their entire filmography. Because most characters in front of and behind desks are likewise searching for control over their lives, we can argue that “no one is in control of their lives.” This is a powerful theme, created by motifs and symbolism, that illuminates the depth and meaning behind the Coen Brothers work. Their sometimes silly and cartoonish dark comedies are really pointing to something much larger than any one film can address. And this is a valuable lesson in screenwriting, directing and filmmaking in general.

xeKIsQV8x40,Jurassic Park & the Spielberg Oner — How to Direct a Long Take like Steven Spielberg,2020-06-01 11:00:37+00:00,"Learn More: How to Shoot a Spielberg Oner ►► https://bit.ly/jp-blocking

Jurassic Park (1993) changed what was possible in filmmaking. Steven Spielberg turned a B-movie premise into one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. But what makes Jurassic Park such a good movie has very little to do with the actual dinosaurs. A vast majority of Jurassic Park is dino-free, and what are we left with? Character development, exposition filled scientific jargon, and themes about parenthood. No, what makes Jurassic Park so good is that Steven Spielberg understands how cinematography and film language can make any scene engaging.

In this Jurassic Park analysis, we’re going to look at Steven Spielberg’s cinematography, especially his long takes and camera movement techniques. By now, you probably know enough about Steven Spielberg’s filmmaking style to know that he loves a good oner. Where most filmmakers will shoot simple coverage, Spielberg will take a simple dialogue scene and shoot it in a long take with dynamic camera movement techniques. But why? Is he just trying to show off or are there valuable cinematic techniques on display?

Consider the scene when John (Richard Attenborough) must convince Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) of his plan to “shut down the system.” Spielberg uses simple blocking, staging, and camera movements to shoot a oner with 4 distinct set-ups. Not only did he save time by shooting this scene in one shot, he made a potentially dry and uninteresting dialogue scene more compelling. As John explains how his plan will work, the camera is drawn towards him and we, the audience, are also being engaged in his plan.

These filmmaking techniques centered around blocking, staging, camera movement and framing are the fundamental building blocks of film language. And no one understands this better than Steven Spielberg.

More examples of Camera Framing ►► https://bit.ly/framing-examples
Ultimate Guide to Camera Shots, Angles and Movements ►► https://bit.ly/shot-size-guide

Camera framing is just one of the many cinematography techniques we’ve all had to learn. Choosing your subject(s) for each shot might seem intuitive but how do you frame them? Do you isolate them in a single or “complicate” things with a “dirty single”? When should you use an over the shoulder shot and does that shot composition always make sense? These are the types of questions we cover in this episode of The Shot List.

A “single” makes sense any time you want to isolate a character, this is such a common framing technique that we barely register them. Adding another character (any number of characters) suddenly changes the dynamics of the moment. Two shots, three shots, all the way up to crowd shots signal a relationship between these subjects. This relationship can be romantic, contentious, awkward, or comedic. These shot compositions all have their place in visual storytelling and every filmmaker should have a firm grasp of this language.

Filmmaking is all about choices and with so many variables to choose from, this isn’t always an easy process. Visual storytelling can be as simple as shooting each character in a single or always shooting over the shoulder shots for a conversation. But don’t underestimate the power of a well-timed and well-placed two-shot. Or the magic that can happen when a POV shot puts the audience in the character’s shoes. With these simple framing and composition techniques, you can elevate your visual storytelling beyond the expected.

gFUtF0gNocM,Reacting to Opening Credits — What Makes a Great Title Sequence?,2020-05-18 11:00:32+00:00,"How to create a great title sequence ►► https://bit.ly/opening-credits-post

Opening credits and title sequences can be purely functional or they can become opportunities to tell a richer story. Film intros (and TV intros) have become artistic achievements of their own over the years. In this episode of The Front Row, we’re going to look at some of the best opening credits through the eyes of a Video Editor and Graphic Designer. They’ll give us their thoughts on what makes these title sequences work and where they fell short, all to give us a better idea of how to design and execute our own opening credits sequences.

The first season of True Detective was amazing (that’s just a fact) but the title sequence is a work of art. In the True Detective intro, we have abstract imagery, overlaid in double exposures and set to a haunting soundtrack. It is only after we progress through the season that we realize they were dropping clues in the True Detective intro the entire time. 

Catch Me If You Can has a slick, throwback film intro in the style of legendary title sequence artist, Saul Bass. The Art Deco animation style set to a bright and jumpy jazz track gives the proper introduction to the story we’re about to see. Like the best movie intros, Catch Me If You Can does not waste this opportunity to enhance the storytelling with the title sequence. 

Dawn of the Dead (2004) offers us an opening credits title sequence that captures the chaos of a full-blown zombie apocalypse. The fragmented editing, as well as credits written in blood, would be enough to get us in the mood — but the filmmakers added a music choice from left field that puts the whole title sequence into a new realm. Johnny Cash’s “The Man Comes Around” is a peppy piece of country folk but juxtaposes nicely with the apocalyptic imagery, making this one of the best movie intros ever.

The opening credits for Tommy Wiseau’s The Room are competent enough from a filmmaking perspective. However, here is an example of a title sequence that feels obligatory and gives us very little information about the world or the character, other than it is set in San Francisco. One of the best movie intros this is not.

As you prepare your next project, consider all the possibilities you have in your opening credits. Set the mood, tease plot elements, introduce a musical theme, grab your audience and hook them into the story about to unfold. By looking at the best opening titles sequences (and one of the worst), you should be well on your way to creating a truly dynamic film intro.

YuZ8Xs64BEo,Contagion — What Soderbergh's Pandemic Got Right About the Coronavirus,2020-05-11 11:00:14+00:00,"Soderbergh best films ranked ►► https://bit.ly/soderbergh-post

Contagion (2011) was a chilling medical thriller upon release — now that COVID-19 has changed our lives forever, Steven Soderbergh’s film now functions more like a documentary. Contagion used to be a “what if…” kind of movie, leaving us to speculate whether it portrayed what life would be like in such a scenario. In hindsight, we can see that Contagion accurately predicted much of our current coronavirus circumstances.

Beyond comparisons to Contagion and our current lives in quarantine, there is something really fascinating about how Steven Soderbergh used the camera to capture a pandemic. Even before COVID-19, watching Contagion had a unique ability to get under our skin, so to speak — but how? In this video essay, we’ll explore the cinematography in Contagion and how Soderbergh used very simple yet effective techniques to make the fictional pandemic feel grounded, and much more terrifying.

Contagion stars Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Laurence Fishburne in a deadly global pandemic. Soderbergh’s filmmaking prioritizes these characters above the macro chaos swirling around them. Most films in this genre focus on an ensemble of survivors but few pay so much attention to the characters in the cinematography. Soderbergh uses three key elements to lock us into these characters: voyeuristic framing, shallow focus, and follow shots that never lose sight of the subject.

By prioritizing the characters and leaving the chaos more to the imagination, Steven Soderbergh keeps this outbreak grounded and real. Now that COVID-19 has shown us what life in quarantine is really like, we can see just how much truth there is in Contagion. Soderbergh’s cinematography and filmmaking skills were never more focused or prescient.

Camera shots and camera angles — every shot, in a scene, in a sequence, and in a movie, needs to be decided on with purpose. Choosing between a close-up or a medium shot can mean a huge difference in how the moment is perceived and felt by the audience. There is psychology at play in film language and film theory, and it is up to the director when making a shot list to speak that language fluently.

In this video essay, we’ll cover the fundamental camera shots at your disposal, how each of them typically operates and how one film used that shot size particularly well. Movies like Coco, Avengers Endgame, The Godfather Part 2, The Favourite, and Phantom Thread use specific camera shots to capture the ideal presentation of a cinematic moment. From establishing shots in Blade Runner 2049 to extreme close ups in Kill Bill, we’ll illustrate the essential building blocks of cinematography.

This is the first episode of a new series called The Shot List, where we break down dozens of possibilities filmmakers have when deciding on camera shots and angles. Cinematography has a language all its own. The next time you sit down to create a shot list, remember that there are many (almost too many) options available. But when you know the power and purpose of each possibility, the decisions become easier and easier.

tcleaQ2IGgU,"How Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Kaufman, and the Safdies Twist Real Life (And You Can Too)",2020-04-27 11:30:15+00:00,"How to write fiction based on true events ►► https://bit.ly/2Vzlckw

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood marks the latest example of Quentin Tarantino taking real-life events and creating a brand new history. In Uncut Gems, the Safdie Brothers also crafted a fictional story around Kevin Garnett and actual NBA playoff games. Charlie Kaufman was meant to adapt a book but failed — and he responded by fictionalizing himself in the process in Adaptation.

What these true story movies have in common is a willingness to bend or even break the truth. In this rather radical approach to screenwriting, real-life and true stories become like potter’s clay in the hands of audacious auteurs like Tarantino, Josh and Benny Safdie, and Charlie Kaufman. The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ending would have been much different had Tarantino stuck to real life. 

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood stars Margot Robbie as real-life actress Sharon Tate, who was brutally murdered by Charles Manson’s psychotic loyalists. Thanks to fictional characters like Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), things didn’t quite turn out that way. In Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler stars alongside Kevin Garnett in a semi-fictional, semi-true thriller, ingeniously crafted by the Safdie Brothers. Adaptation stars Nicolas Cage as the real Charlie Kaufman...and his fictional twin brother Donald.

Screenwriters take note — the truth is excellent material and you don’t always have to stay true to real life. True stories are almost always augmented with fictional elements — but it takes bold choices like Tarantino, the Safdies, and Charlie Kaufman to create truly original and thrilling fictions based on true stories.

D5qyna6kcGA,Parasite Analysis — Bong Joon Ho's Mastery of Genre and Tone,2020-04-20 11:30:02+00:00,"Parasite's Mid-Point Tonal Shift ►► https://bit.ly/parasitetone

Parasite (2019) took the world by storm. This parable struck a chord and rode a wave of critical and popular opinion all the way to become one of the Best Picture nominees in 2020 — and eventual Best Picture winner. Director Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, Okja, Mother, The Host, Memories of Murder and Barking Dogs Never Bite) brought his filmmaking to a new level with Parasite, especially his ability to transition between contrasting tones of dark comedy and thriller.

In this video essay, Parasite’s mid-point twist is examined in detail — including the way dark comedy and thriller are mixed into something truly unsettling. In Parasite, movie language tells us a “dark concrete basement” means danger but then elements of slapstick comedy drop into frame (literally, when the Kim’s fall down the stairs). Only the hand of a master director like Bong Joon-ho can pull off a scene like this. 

Parasite is by no means Bong Joon-ho’s first attempt to bring politics into his films. Likewise, mixing genre and tone is something he has also been perfecting in his recent films like Okja and Snowpiercer. Filmmaking and directing is all about balancing multiple elements to tell a layered and nuanced story like Parasite has done. Who needs film school when you have filmmaker’s like Bong Joon-ho giving us a masterclass like he did in Parasite?

Jojo Rabbit (2019) isn’t only one of the best movies of the year, it might also have one of the most emotional scenes in recent memory. It isn’t just “what” happens in this Jojo Rabbit scene, it is “how” writer/director Taika Waititi set us up for a gut-punch and directs the scene using visual, narrative, and thematic motifs. 

What is Jojo Rabbit About? Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a misguided Hitler youth living with his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), in WWII Germany. The film also stars Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, and Taika Waititi himself as Adolf Hitler. This satire comedy hits many emotional notes on innocence and independence — as Taika Waititi movies like Boy (2010) and Hunt For the Wilderpeople (2016) are known to do. But Jojo Rabbit goes straight for the heart.

A motif is any element repeated in a film that is meant to carry significance. In Jojo Rabbit, we have visual motifs like butterflies and tying shoes that seem inconsequential but they actually play a huge role in setting the emotional impact of the film’s climax. If we can learn anything from Taika Waititi in this Jojo Rabbit analysis, it’s how to use motifs and clues to make a devastating moment that much more so.

Denis Villeneuve movies are made to confuse you. At every opportunity — in the story, in the cinematography, editing, and music, Villeneuve wants to keep you guessing. Watching Denis Villeneuve movies is to be placed in an environment of uncertainty. And that’s what makes them so interesting.

In films like Enemy, Prisoners, Polytechnique, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival, Villeneuve consistently creates awe and wonder with images and sounds we’ve never seen before. In Enemy, Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) must confront the possibility that he is more than a single person. In Sicario, Kate (Emily Blunt) is pushed into the world of drug cartels by a tight-lipped company man (Josh Brolin) and a near-silent assassin (Benicio Del Toro). In Prisoners, Keller (Hugh Jackman) ventures into murky moral territory to find his kidnapped daughter. In Arrival, Louise (Amy Adams) and Ian (Jeremy Renner) are tasked with bridging the communication gap between beings from another dimension. In all these movies, the characters find themselves in new worlds without answers.

In this video, we’ve cracked the code on Villeneuve’s love of ambiguity and we explain how his directing style works across 7 areas of focus including sound, color, production design, and more. Villeneuve creates movies that can be enigmatic but there’s no denying that he is a film artist in complete control of his medium. 

If you’re studying directing, cinematography, editing, or pursuing ANY career in filmmaking, there are a ton of lessons to be learned from Denis Villeneuve. This is the ultimate breakdown of Denis Villeneuve’s directing style.

vunqE5xP_9c,The Irishman — How Scorsese Opens an Epic [Director's Playbook],2020-03-30 11:00:20+00:00,"The Irishman Opening Scene Breakdown ►► https://bit.ly/39uEFqo

The Irishman (2019) is a Martin Scorsese epic — and that’s saying something. The Irishman follows mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) through a life of horrendous deeds working for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) but it is how Martin Scorsese introduces us to Frank and his world that has us captivated from the opening shot.

Martin Scorsese movies, including Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street, Goodfellas, Shutter Island, The Departed, Taxi Driver, and Gangs of New York, are known for how they build worlds around the character and The Irishman is no exception. In this opening shot, Scorsese gives us a subdued and contemplative long take. The leisurely pace allows us to take in the sights and sounds of Frank’s life near the end. The camera tracks through a nursing home as a tune from the Five Satins plays on the soundtrack — a mournful track about memory and days gone by. And at the end of the shot, we find Frank, alone and wistful — fully prepared to journey back to hear the tale of The Irishman.

The Irishman is one of the many Martin Scorsese movies to showcase filmmaking at its peak — and The Irishman scene that sets this 3.5 hour epic in motion is full of meaning and purpose. With The Irishman, Netflix movies took a giant leap up in quality filmmaking.

cJYW3-A1tbI,Arrival — How Villeneuve Balances Fear and Intrigue [Director's Playbook],2020-03-23 11:30:03+00:00,"Arrival film breakdown with storyboards ►► https://bit.ly/2wgIxOc

Arrival (2016) is a science fiction movie that found a new language, literally. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Blade Runner 2049, Prisoners) brings his unique brand of filmmaking to the table to keep up guessing. In Arrival, aliens have come to Earth, seeking communication and it is up to a linguist played by Amy Adams and a physicist played by Jeremy Renner to lead the effort. The end result is a masterclass not only in science fiction movies, but filmmaking and directing.

In this scene from Arrival, Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner’s characters meet the heptapods for the first time. Unsure of the aliens’ motives, they proceed with caution — they are fascinated by the heptapods but inextricably drawn to them. So, how does Denis Villeneuve create a situation that balances fear and intrigue? 

Using simple shot choices and frame compositions, Denis Villeneuve brings Arrival to the top of science fiction movies. He keeps the heptapods mysterious yet familiar, threatening yet passive — and the overall experience of watching Arrival is a thrilling mix of fear and intrigue. Any student of directing and filmmaking can learn a lot from Denis Villeneuve and Arrival, one of the best science fiction movies in recent years.

Darren Aronofsky movies are about characters heading for destruction. They are either following a dream, a passion, a career or an addiction, but it all leads to the same place. Aronofsky isn’t the first director to tackle such dark themes but he has mastered extreme techniques that make his films stand alone. 

In films like Pi and Requiem for a Dream, Aronofsky redefines extreme cinema with arresting and aggressive techniques. In The Fountain and Noah, he pulls back on technique and allows a more graceful presentation of madness. The Wrestler and Black Swan become complementary movies about professions that demand physical transformations. For these films, Darren Aronofsky films abandon his aggressive formalism for a gritty and lo-fi aesthetic. 

Darren Aronofsky movies get under your skin and he uses every film element to make this happen. In this video, we’ve broken down Darren Aronofsky’s directing style into 7 categories including cinematography, editing, music, color, and more. By examining these elements in isolation, we can understand the big picture and begin to see what makes Aronofsky’s films so distinct and gripping.

n1EKLvdUSac,Video Lighting Techniques — Nailing that Cinematic Look (with a Fill Light),2020-03-09 11:30:06+00:00,"More Video Lighting Techniques ►► http://bit.ly/334Jq8v
More Cinematography Techniques, including a FREE Cinematography Checklist ►► http://bit.ly/3cxqK5z 

Film lighting techniques can be simple, especially with a simple three-point lighting setup. But that doesn’t mean that you still can’t achieve that cinematic look. Cinematic lighting can be achieved with the 3 main light sources — the key light, the fill light, and the backlight. This combination is used in a large majority of film lighting setups and each light fulfills a function. What we want to explore in this video is just how important the fill light is to the overall look and feel of a shot. Of all three lights, the fill light just might the most important.

Contrast ratio is the relationship between the key light and fill light — in short, more fill light yields a low contrast lighting, while less fill light will achieve more high contrast lighting. Contrast ratio is all about determining the mood of a scene and that’s where the fill light’s purpose becomes so important. So many film lighting techniques revolve around adjusting contrast ratio through raising or lowering the level of the fill light.

Another aspect of film lighting techniques is the placement of each of these lights. In many cases, the key light is placed on the “smart side” of the subject — that is to say on the opposite side of the camera — and the fill light is often pointed at the subject from the same side as the camera (i.e., the “dumb side”). This is not a hard and fast rule in cinematic lighting but it does wonders for creating a layer of depth in the image. For many reasons, you can switch it up (e.g., dumb side key and smart side fill). It just depends on the scene and how you want to capture the moment.

See the Complete Goldmember Intro Storyboards ►► http://bit.ly/2wBii4s
Check out Sundance Co//ab ►► http://bit.ly/2TDMXWQ 

The Austin Powers in Goldmember opening scene is the definition of a show-stopper. From the star-studded cameos like Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Danny DeVito to the over-the-top action filmmaking — it is a sight to behold. But how did director Jay Roach pull this scene off? 

In this video, we partner with Sundance Collab and Jay Roach to walk us through the filmmaking process behind creating the Austin Powers 3 opening sequence — and we’ll be taking a look at never-before-seen Austin Powers: Goldmember storyboards as we do it. For the Austin Powers in Goldmember opening scene, Jay Roach discusses how he balanced tone and contrast between each segment. Buckle your belts for some very groovy filmmaking theory baby, yeah! 

For Austin Powers 3, the filmmakers really had to step it up, starting with a hilariously ridiculous action sequence — which, as Roach explains, would not have been possible without “pure preparation” that starts with storyboarding and directing considerations for tone and contrast.

Then the Austin Powers in Goldmember intro breaks the 4th wall and turns into a Hollywood musical and that iconic Austin Powers dance. The different modes of comedy on display during the Austin Powers in Goldmember opening scene is a masterclass in directing comedy, action, and tone.

You might not have the budget (or Tom Cruise) to pull off the intro to your next film, but the lessons here still apply — be prepared, make a storyboard, and approach each scene as if it were as bold and dynamic as the Austin Powers in Goldmember opening scene. For more, including the entire collection of Austin Powers storyboards, follow the link to our blog.

Brainstorming ideas is no easy task — and it gets even more difficult when you’re trying to come up with commercial ideas for marketing a product. Pitching a marketing strategy starts with understanding what that product is and how best to communicate that to the intended demographics. In this video, we’ll go through the process of marketing a product with brainstorming techniques. 

Brainstorming techniques for marketing a product starts with understanding the value proposition — what does this product do and how does that provide value to the consumer? After that, other brainstorming activities you can try include free association and research which can lead to further ideas on how to sell a product.

Our subjects in this pitch competition have to come up with branded content ideas for a motor oil product — something neither of them has much knowledge of or experience with. But after utilizing some of these brainstorming techniques, the commercial ideas start to flood in. Storyboarding is a key element in any sort of marketing presentation because making these ideas visual is absolutely important to help communicate the commercial ideas directly to the client.

Brainstorming techniques and storyboarding branded content commercial ideas is the name of the game. With these tools under your belt, you’ll be able to approach pitch competitions and marketing presentations with the confidence of a true professional.

EJ4b0yM6MKE,The Needle Drop — What Fuels the Best Movie Soundtracks?,2020-02-24 12:30:01+00:00,"Hear More of the Best Movie Soundtracks ►► http://bit.ly/best-movie-songs
More Directing Videos ►► http://bit.ly/2SMTez2

In this filmmaking video essay, we look at some of the best movie soundtracks to see how filmmakers’ music cues — or “needle drops” — create iconic cinema. The term “needle drop” refers to when a popular song is placed strategically in a scene. Here, our case studies of epic movie soundtracks are American Psycho, Thor: Ragnarok, and Almost Famous. 

In a scene that famously features Huey Lewis and the News’ “Hip to Be Square,” the American Psycho soundtrack creates cognitive dissonance for viewers, juxtaposing the song’s upbeat tone with a grisly murder. The Thor: Ragnarok soundtrack uses Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song” to celebrate its fallen hero’s return to glory. And the Almost Famous soundtrack cues up Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” to create a moment of release for its characters at the film’s climax.

The needle drops in truly great movie soundtracks are designed to affect audiences in an extremely specific way. Some of these movie songs are tied directly to the plot, while others may intentionally offset the film’s tone to create irony. 

Discerning directors also use music to introduce leitmotifs, and we’ll take a look at that, too — from Jaws to The Godfather to The Royal Tenenbaums. So, with our eyes and ears open, let’s explore the monumental importance of soundtrack in film.

More Director's Playbook ►► http://bit.ly/2SMTez2

In this Once Upon a Time in Hollywood analysis, we’re going to look at how Quentin Tarantino directs one of the most suspenseful scenes in the film. Using a number of techniques from Tarantino’s bag of tricks, he crafts a scene that recalls some of his greatest influences — Sergio Leone and Alfred Hitchcock.

We’ve seen suspense sequences many times before in Quentin Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, and The Hateful Eight. In this Once Upon a Time in Hollywood scene, he brings that same level of “Quentin Tarantino filmmaking” to the moment Cliff Booth arrives at Spahn Ranch.

After his Oscar win, we are reminded that Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a performance worth studying. In this scene, Cliff is highly suspicious of these individuals who have taken residence at Spahn Ranch — and all he wants is to make sure his old friend, George, is alive and well. But that journey from his car to George’s house is chock full of suspense.

Using directorial choices like POV shots, breaking the 180-degree rule, shot composition, editing and sound design, Quentin Tarantino brings his A-game. In this Once Upon a Time in Hollywood analysis, we’ll dig deep into the scene to see how he brought all of these elements together to create one of the most memorable scenes in the film.

7KjHsurAJpc,"Joker Analysis — Comparing Heath Ledger, Nicholson and Phoenix's Villains",2020-02-10 12:30:01+00:00,"List of Best Jokers ►► http://bit.ly/joker-breakdown

The Joker is a villain we all recognize. Whether you’ve seen Tim Burton’s Batman, Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, or Todd Phillips’ most recent interpretation in Joker (2019) — we know the Joker’s costume, the Joker’s makeup, and, of course, the Joker’s laugh. But what happens when directors like Nolan, Burton and Phillips get their hands on this iconic villain?

This video essay is all about artistic license and how different filmmakers have taken the core foundation for The Clown Prince of Crime and molded him to fit their particular vision. The white face, red lips, green hair, and purple suit remain consistent (for the most part) but the characters and personalities behind that iconic costume and makeup vary wildly. 

Our first example finds Tim Burton directing Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Batman (1989). Here we have a mafioso turned madman, leaning heavily into the original version of The Joker — both homicidal and humorous. In The Dark Knight, and Christopher Nolan’s interpretation of The Joker, Heath Ledger brings a more serious and unpredictable anarchy to the table. And, most recently, Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker is a more accidental villain — a product of a failed system in Todd Phillips’ almost revisionist take on the character.

How do all these interpretations of The Joker fit into their respective worlds? And how do they add up to an amalgamation of the character? If there’s a villain who is ripe for multiple personalities, it’s The Joker.

rvPj65RKYf4,There Will Be Blood — How PT Anderson Directs Dominance and Disgrace,2020-02-03 12:30:04+00:00,"There Will Be Blood Analysis ►► http://bit.ly/there-will-be-blood-analysis

There Will Be Blood (2007) is not only one of Paul Thomas Anderson’s best movies, but it might also rank as one of the best all time. Daniel Day-Lewis is stellar as the vicious oil baron Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as his would-be nemesis Eli Sunday create sparks every time they share the screen.

Paul Thomas Anderson began his career with high energy and bombastic films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. There Will Be Blood marks a dramatic shift in tone and energy for PT Anderson — ultimately leading to more reserved but nonetheless powerful films like The Master, Inherent Vice, and Phantom Thread.

In this There Will Be Blood analysis, Paul Thomas Anderson brings these two feuding characters to a breaking point. Paul Thomas Anderson films this scene in such a way that we identify with Eli — both during his nervous approach to Daniel and his ultimate denigration in the mud and oil. But how does he do this?

PT Anderson makes simple and direct film blocking and staging choices to capture two things simultaneously — Daniel’s dominance and Eli’s disgrace. To do this, Paul Thomas Anderson uses the camera to occupy Eli or Eli’s point of view at all times. Even when Daniel begins to beat Eli into the ground, we (the camera) drops to that occupy that perspective. In There Will Be Blood, cinematography plays a key role in capturing this violent dynamic.

OXwqDkyAmeY,The Godfather — How to Direct Power (Director’s Playbook),2020-01-27 12:30:01+00:00,"More on The Godfather analysis ►► http://bit.ly/36lai3P

The Godfather is an undisputed cinema classic...but why? What makes it so good? It's a story about the transformation of Michael Corleone from someone on the sidelines of the family business into a true leader. The Godfather is about POWER — who has it, who wants it, and what people are willing to do to get it.

In this scene breakdown, watch how director Francis Ford Coppola takes a simple dispute and captures the transitions in power between Sonny (James Caan) and Tom (Robert Duvall), before Michael (Al Pacino) inserts himself and takes complete control. Using framing, composition, blocking and a slow, deliberate camera move, we ""feel"" these power shifts as much as we see them.

The Godfather analysis in this video essay focuses on how director Francis Ford Coppola used blocking and staging to visually capture the power dynamics within the Corleone family. Specifically, how Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) takes his first steps towards inserting himself in the family business...and his first steps towards becoming The Godfather.

With Don Corleone hospitalized, Sonny and Tom are at odds with whether revenge is the appropriate tactic. In this scene, Michael goes from a passive observer of the family’s business to an active participant. This power dynamic is clear from the dialogue in the script but what does Francis Ford Coppola do with the blocking and staging to emphasize these ideas? How does he use shot types and composition to communicate Michael’s evolution? That’s what this The Godfather analysis is all about.

Francis Ford Coppola will go down as one of the greatest directors of all time. After a series of independent and underseen films, Coppola broke out in a big way with The Godfather. From there, it was a series of masterpieces like The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, and the completion of The Godfather trilogy. 

The Godfather cinematography is legendary, thanks to DP Gordon Willis (aka The Prince of Darkness) but his lighting is just the beginning. In this video essay on The Godfather analysis, you’ll see how power and control can exchange hands with simple techniques like blocking & staging.

M. Night Shyamalan is a filmmaker worth studying. He’s had some misfires and spectacular flops, but when he’s good...he’s really good. In this video, we’re going to examine what makes Shyamalan movies tick and how the twist endings are just the beginning.

After one unseen indie and a harmless family film, M. Night Shyamalan broke through the pop culture stratosphere with The Sixth Sense. Then, a series of critical and popular hits like Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village. Lately, Shyamalan has been making films that mark a clear return to form — The Visit, Split and Glass remind us that the filmmaker phenom he once was still has more to say.

M. Night Shyamalan has made some amazing movies...and some real duds. Love him or hate him, there's still a lot we can learn from his work. Like any true auteur, Shyamalan has a very distinct filmmaking style and that's what we're here to explore.

This journey through Shyamalan's style will cover his entire filmography and 7 main areas of his formal technique. From his use of multi-plane storytelling, expressive music cues, fascination with colors, his tendency towards long takes, and his dynamic camera movement, we can see that strong choices are being made.

Great directors have a command of all these areas of filmmaking — and they're able to make them all work together to present a singular vision. For us, Shyamalan meets this criteria.
What's your take on Shyamalan? If you're on the fence, watch this video and give us your answer in the comments. ⁠

zLASrjAYjwg,The Wolf of Wall Street Film Blocking Techniques | Director's Playbook,2020-01-13 12:30:06+00:00,"How Scorsese Stages The Wolf of Wall Street ►► http://bit.ly/wows-staging

In today's video, we dive into Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street to better understand how blocking and staging can create a dynamic long take. A long take can be a great opportunity to get through exposition quickly and concisely, with staging and blocking motivating action and making things feel natural. Martin Scorsese was able to accomplish all of these things effortlessly in The Wolf of Wall Street.

In this scene, Scorsese directs with purposeful framing, camera movement and eye lines to keep the chaotic office environment clear and focused for the audience. Moving through many rooms, around characters, and through a chaotic stock floor could easily confuse the viewer.

To keep the story in focus, Scorsese uses a few techniques to his advantage. First, he uses eye lines to help guide the viewer's eye, helping to motivate the camera's pan over to the conference room. He also uses a series of ""hand-offs"" to help keep the viewer focused on what is in front of them, while still being able to effortlessly glide between them.

These simple techniques can apply to any long take. By directing the viewer's attention with eye lines, the audience has a chance to maintain visual geography of the action. And with character hand-offs, we also keep the characters and their relationship at the forefront. Prioritizing character can help keep a long take from coming off as gratuitous when we understand WHY we are watching it.

LGwpKeMjUxw,The Best Star Wars Lightsaber Duels — What Makes Them Iconic?,2020-01-06 12:30:01+00:00,"Star Wars Lightsaber Duels ►► http://bit.ly/lightsaber-duels
Staging the Star Wars Throne Room Battle ►► http://bit.ly/36AH1mY

One of the best aspects of Star Wars are the Lightsaber Duels. 

In this video, we continue to break down the lightsaber battles in Star Was by creating a video essay that looks at the various components that make up a great lightsaber battle. Our filmmaking video essay looks at the directing, camera techniques, and production design of the Star Wars lightsaber duels so you can understand why they work so well. 

The Lightsaber Battles took the excitement of classic fencing films and combined them with science fiction. Some of the lightsaber duels, like The Empire Strikes Back had the Cloud City lightsaber battle on the Bespin mining facility, mark some of the most important moments of the films. This is where we got to see Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker have their first lightsaber battle. 

Similarly, you have the Revenge of the Sith duel on Mustafar between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. There are some lightsaber fights, like the Duel of the Fates in The Phantom Menace, where the skills of the combatants are on full display. Who doesn’t love watching as Darth Maul Lightsaber, fights off two Jedi in Qui Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. 

The lightsaber battles in all of the Star Wars films, whether they were made by Fox or Disney or Lucasfilm — all of them are symbolic of the eternal struggle between the light side and the dark side. The lightsaber colors also play a part, and of course who could forget the first time they heard those iconic lightsaber sound effects.

pEVmojYnGFM,Star Wars Lightsaber Staging — Camera Movement in 'The Last Jedi' Battle [Director's Playbook],2019-12-30 13:30:02+00:00,"Lightsaber Duel Scene Breakdown ►► http://bit.ly/353nWrP

The Last Jedi lightsaber duel is an excellent example of how an action scene can be both easy to follow and emotionally connected. Lightsaber duels are one of the most iconic and exciting elements in Star Wars. The idea of laser swords has evolved from a B-movie idea to sophisticated and elaborate action scenes. And there is perhaps no better example of a great lightsaber battle than the Throne Room scene in The Last Jedi. 

In this scene, Rian Johnson directs the scene with purposeful framing, camera movement and editing to keep the action legible and the character relationships in focus. With 10 people fighting in the scene, it could easily devolve into a free-for-all, producing a chaotic situation for the audience to comprehend. 

To keep the action clean and legible, Rian Johnson uses a few techniques to his advantage. First, he maximizes various shots to include multiple actions, which allows him to AVOID editing and gives the audience a better chance to keep everything straight. He also uses camera movement to include both Kylo Ren and Rey in the same shot, even if they’re fighting across the room. And he also uses framing to construct the opposing sides to the fight.

These simple techniques can apply to any fight scene. By slowing down the action and less cuts, the audience has a chance to maintain visual geography of the action. And with camera movement and framing, we also keep the characters and their relationship at the forefront. Prioritizing character can help keep an action scene from coming off as gratuitous when we understand WHY we are watching it.

888mpiRYCjU,Jingle All the Way — A Complete Deconstruction of the Capitalist Machine,2019-12-23 12:30:01+00:00,"Hidden Messages in Jingle All The Way ►► http://bit.ly/2SeqhgE

In today’s video essay we do some film analysis on what may, or may not, be considered a classic in the genre of Christmas movies. The Christmas movie is Jingle All the Way, which was produced by Chris Columbus and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sindbad, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, Jim Belushi, Martin Mull, and the late-great Phil Hartman.

As far as Christmas movies go, Jingle All the Way was an attempt to expose the darker side of capitalism, commercialism, and consumerism by using the exact methods mentioned to drive viewers to the theaters and cash in on the Holiday movie frenzy.

A succinct way of putting it is that Jingle All the Way is the type of Christmas movie that fights fire with fire, and our video essay and film analysis aims to find the deeper meaning in this Holiday film and to touch on some of the blocking and staging used in this Christmas movie that may, or may not, be geometric easter eggs for the Soul of Christmas. 

Now, that isn’t to say that the film doesn’t do a really good job of showing how our own lives and family values can often be too involved with buying affection, but I suppose there is a more effective and noble way of doing so.  

Jingle All the Way sets out to be a fun Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy and is truly elevated by the performances from Sinbad and Phil Hartman. Arnold Schwarzenegger is good in the film, and Rita Wilson delivers on the shallow character she’s afforded by the script, but the fact is that the movie is well shot and paced perfectly. 

To this day, Jingle All the Way serves as a Holiday movie worth a watch even if we can all admit it not the best Christmas movie of all time, but it has its moments and some of the best we got to see of Phil Hartman.

Welcome to episode 6 of Making It — This is the finale of our series where we took you through the entire filmmaking process and shows you how to make a movie. You followed screenwriter and director SC Lannom and producer Herman Wilkins as they took you through each step of pre-production and showed you how to build a proof of concept can for a television show idea by creating a pilot presentation for a television show idea.

The filmmakers collaborated with a talented crew made up of Marvin Nuecklaus as the director of photography, and Kari Lane as the 1st assistant director. The short film featured a talented cast including Jasmine Stone, Greg Couet, Tim Blewitt, John Henry Richardson, and Caleb Thomas. Hopefully, this series helped you build your own directing career with a proof of concept for a tv show idea or a movie idea you may have. 

Writing a screenplay or pilot is an important part of the filmmaking process, but getting that pilot script produced and financed can be difficult, and even if you do get someone to accept your script there is a small chance it will be given the attention it needs to become a produced film or tv show. 

That’s why you need a tv show proof of concept.

TV producers, talent agents, managers - all are super busy and don’t have time to read through a bunch of “could be great” scripts. However, people will watch just about anything, especially if it only takes less than 15 minutes. That’s why you can take matters into your own hands and build a proof of concept for a comedy TV show just like we did.

If you’ve ever wondered about how to make a short film, this new series will teach you much of what you need to know, and you’ll be able to watch a working film producer and screenwriter/director as they navigate the entire filmmaking process. You’ll learn things here that you won’t find in film school, and our team uses many high-level filmmaking tools in our quest to teach you how to make a TV show starting with a pilot presentation.

Jay Roach explains his process of directing scenes in this new film from Lionsgate Pictures. You will learn advanced techniques and tips from Jay as he takes you behind the scenes and touches on some of the techniques and preparation for Bombshell.

Jay Roach has built a successful career examining political climates and some of the most interesting true stories that affect us in our daily lives.

In today’s video, we invited acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke to discuss her work on Twilight. Specifically, Hardwicke breaks down the action scene early in the film when Bella is attacked in the ballet studio. As she explains, the goal of this scene was to give the action as much emotional depth as possible — and to fortify the emotional bond between Bella and Edward. 

What are the directorial choices that Hardwicke made to ensure that the action is compelling while the emotional connection remains intact? As Catherine Hardwicke explains, her approach included every filmmaking element at her disposal. With shot size, framing, sound design, camera angles, and more, Hardwicke attempted to create an emotionally resonant action scene.

As a filmmaker, having direct access and insight into the work of a director like Catherine Hardwicke is invaluable. She has proven during her career, with films like Thirteen, Red Riding Hood, and The Lords of Dogtown, that she is a filmmaker with a clear vision and a strong sense of style. Her work on Twilight is equally strong and we can learn a lot from Catherine Hardwicke.

Today’s video is Episode 5 of our pre-production series - Making It. This episode will show screenwriter and director SC Lannom and producer Herman Wilkins as they assemble a film crew, rent filming equipment, and secure the costumes, props, and set design for the pilot presentation. They get a ton of help securing the gaffer, 1st assistant camera operator, key grip, and more from cinematographer Marvin Nuecklaus. 

Part of the pre-production process is understanding where to find movie props, set design, and costumes for your short film. You also need crew which will include your camera department made up of at least a 1st assistant camera operator and cinematographer, but also your general and electric department which will include your gaffer, key grip, and any additional grips you’ll need to place equipment and set up lighting.

You’ll also need to secure a hair and makeup artist as well as a costume designer and production designer who can make your world come to life with set design, costumes, and props that fit your production needs. 

All of these film jobs are integral to the success of your short film and filmmaking in general, but the other side of this is securing your film equipment rentals as well as production insurance for your film gear. If you hope to get a great looking film using professional cameras and lenses, then you’ll need to have at the very least some form of liability insurance so any damaged equipment can be covered and doesn’t end up costing you more than your entire budget. Our budget is about the same as a single lens, so affordable insurance is a much better option than crossing our fingers.

At the very end, you’ll see how the call sheet brings everyone together on the day of your film shoot, and how StudioBinder call sheets are the best because they send notifications to email and your mobile device as well as tracking confirmation status of each crew member so that you have perfect clarity on who will be on set and who you need to follow up with to confirm receipt of the call sheet. Another important thing about the call sheet is information on nearby hospitals, parking for the cast and crew, call times so that people aren’t on set for an unnecessary amount of time, and more. 

This series takes you from pre-production to post-production to show you how to make a movie or tv show idea become reality. In this web series, we take a short film and tv show idea and go through the process of directing movies and each of the film production careers associated with creating a proof of concept for a comedy tv show idea. 

No filmmaking theory here, just a step by step process of what it looks like to create a proof of concept tv show. The filmmaking process is shown to you in detail, and you will be able to see just how hectic making a TV show pilot on a small budget can be. 

Take what you learn from this filmmaking web series and apply it to your next project, whether you’re a director, cinematographer, editor, screenwriter, or filmmaker in general. See how to find and secure crew, find film locations, build shot lists, collaborate with your filmmaking team, see camera work decisions, and filmmaking problem-solving in real-time.

We use our StudioBinder filmmaking tool along the way, so you can see how call sheets, contacts lists, script breakdowns, and more can help you create your own tv show idea on a very small professional budget.

Today’s video is Episode 4 of our pre-production series - Making It. This episode will show you how to hold auditions, how to find the right actors for your project, and how to cast your short film. We take you through a bunch of auditions and the overall casting process so that you can see what it’s like to hold your own casting call for actors. 

Casting is a huge part of the filmmaking process and finding the right actors for your short film can make all the difference. When you cast the right actors it makes your job as a director that much easier. It’s important to hold auditions correctly and to find a space that not only makes the actors comfortable but somewhere that you feel good directing actors.

Some actors will become “call-backs” and others might submit themselves through self-tapes. Some actors will have talent agents and managers that you’ll need to go through, and you’ll also want to think about actors unions like SAG.

This episode also shows our cast and crew holding a table read through, which is an important moment for the cast and the director to get on the same page creatively. It’s much easier to give notes and direct a performance when you’re not on set, so that way your actors know exactly what you’re hoping for when the shoot day arrives.
 
This series takes you from pre-production to post-production to show you how to make a movie or tv show idea become reality. In this web series, we take a short film and tv show idea and go through the process of directing movies and each of the film production careers associated with creating a proof of concept for a comedy tv show idea. 

No filmmaking theory here, just a step by step process of what it looks like to create a proof of concept tv show. The filmmaking process is shown to you in detail, and you will be able to see just how hectic making a TV show pilot on a small budget can be. 

Take what you learn from this filmmaking web series and apply it to your next project, whether you’re a director, cinematographer, editor, screenwriter, or filmmaker in general. See how to find and secure crew, find film locations, build shot lists, collaborate with your filmmaking team, see camera work decisions, and filmmaking problem-solving in real-time.

We use our StudioBinder filmmaking tool along the way, so you can see how call sheets, contacts lists, script breakdowns, and more can help you create your own tv show idea on a very small professional budget.

In today's video, we're going to take a look at how you can shoot cinematic B-roll footage for your movies and videos. Our filmmaking video essay will take you through the steps of coming up with concepts for your B-roll footage. 

What is B-roll footage?

If you're looking for the B-roll definition this is the perfect filmmaking video essay for you. We're going to show you some of our favorite B roll shooting tips by showing you various B-roll examples we captured to mimic some of our favorite directors. B-roll shots are used in news production, online videos, and anything that might require additional footage. 

When shooting B-roll, you want to consider the tone of your project and get the B-roll shots that will mesh well with the rest of your video. It's important that your B-roll shots are different shot sizes so your edits can work better. 

One of the first lessons you learn in film school about directing is to get coverage, whether you're directing for TV or movies. There are few filmmaking tools that are as effective as good footage. When it comes to editing your projects, B-roll can end up being your best friend. This can be movie B-roll, video, or B-roll for online videos - whatever. What is B-roll? It's footage that fills gaps, saves your videos, and helps to build mood and tone. 

That's the power of smooth B-roll. 

B-roll is a type of camera shot type that captures footage that is separate from your main action. B-roll is one of the most useful shot types in film. We'll go over the B-roll definition and meaning so that you can not only capture better B-roll, but understand the best ways to use it later on when editing your videos.

Today’s video is Episode 2 of our pre-production series - Making It. This episode will show you how to perform a script breakdown and how to budget for your film as well as how to hire key crew members like the first assistant director and director of photography. Follow screenwriter and director SC Lannom and producer Herman Wilkins as they reach out to department heads Kari Lane and Marvin Nuecklaus for the respective positions of 1st assistant director and director of photography. 

First assistant directors are in charge of safety on set as well as being in charge of time management, so it’s the 1st AD’s job to make sure the film production stays on schedule. The first assistant director is one of the most important members of your film crew, so you want to make sure you find someone that is reliable and confident. 

The other key crew member to hire early is the director of photography. The reason you want to hire your director of photography (or cinematographer) early is so that they and the director can get on the same page. 

They need to discuss lighting, what kind of special equipment and cameras they might use, and get a general sense of each other’s creative values and priorities. You can also discuss shot sizes, frame rates, camera focus, and any other important creative decisions. 
This series takes you from pre-production to post-production to show you how to make a movie or tv show idea become reality.

Today’s video begins our pre-production series for Making It. This series will take you through the complete filmmaking process. We show you how to build your own directing career with a proof of concept for a tv show idea or a movie idea you may have. You'll watch screenwriter and director SC Lannom and producer Herman Wilkins as they go through the entire pre-production process to make a pilot presentation to serve as a proof of concept for a Television series.  

Writing a screenplay or pilot is an important part of the filmmaking process, but getting that pilot script produced and financed can be difficult, and even if you do get someone to accept your script there is a small chance it will be given the attention it needs to become a produced film or tv show. That’s why you need a tv show proof of concept.

TV producers, talent agents, managers - all are super busy and don’t have time to read through a bunch of “could be great” scripts. However, people will watch just about anything, especially if it only takes less than 15 minutes. That’s why you can take matters into your own hands and build a proof of concept for a comedy TV show just like we did. 

Learn the directing process of a comedy TV show that you won’t find in film school. 

We take you from pre-production to post-production to show you how to make a movie or tv show idea become reality. In this web series, we take a short film and tv show idea and go through the process of directing movies and each of the film production careers associated with creating a proof of concept for a comedy tv show idea. 

No filmmaking theory here, just a step by step process of what it looks like to create a proof of concept tv show. The filmmaking process is shown to you in detail, and you will be able to see just how hectic making a TV show pilot on a small budget can be. 

Take what you learn from this filmmaking web series and apply it to your next project, whether you’re a director, cinematographer, editor, screenwriter, or filmmaker in general. See how to find and secure crew, find film locations, build shot lists, collaborate with your filmmaking team, see camera work decisions, and filmmaking problem-solving in real-time.

We use our StudioBinder filmmaking tool along the way, so you can see how call sheets, contacts lists, script breakdowns, and more can help you create your own tv show idea on a very small professional budget.

Watch the Series ►► http://bit.ly/2npUUCS

Our new series, Making It, takes you inside the entire filmmaking process and shows you how to make a movie. We take you through each step of pre-production and show you how building a proof of concept can be a big step in cultivating your directing career. This series will take you through the complete filmmaking process. 

We show you how to build your own directing career with a proof of concept for a tv show idea or a movie idea you may have. Writing a screenplay or pilot is an important part of the filmmaking process, but getting that pilot script produced and financed can be difficult, and even if you do get someone to accept your script there is a small chance it will be given the attention it needs to become a produced film or tv show. 

That’s why you need a tv show proof of concept.

TV producers, talent agents, managers - all are super busy and don’t have time to read through a bunch of “could be great” scripts. However, people will watch just about anything, especially if it only takes less than 15 minutes. That’s why you can take matters into your own hands and build a proof of concept for a comedy TV show just like we did.

You’ll see as we tackle everything from: 

Directing 
Screenwriting
Cinematography 
Producing
Actor Auditions
Production Design
Makeup Artists
Sound Mixing
& More

If you’ve ever wondered about how to make a short film, this new series will teach you much of what you need to know, and you’ll be able to watch a working film producer and screenwriter/director as they navigate the entire filmmaking process. You’ll learn things here that you won’t find in film school, and our team uses many high-level filmmaking tools in our quest to teach you how to make a TV show starting with a pilot presentation.

Today’s video is a scene analysis and video essay on staging and blocking your scenes like Spielberg’s Minority Report, Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, and Inarritu’s Birdman.

There are a few secrets to directing a cinematic scene. Above basic filmmaking theory is the actual craft of filmmaking, which includes staging and blocking your scenes in your films or television shows. 
This is something you can learn without the need for film school because composition in film is something you can only learn through careful film analysis and on set experience as a director. 

Blocking in film can seem simple enough until you actually step on set, and that’s when you learn that directing a movie is far from easy. Our video essay and film analysis explains some of the profound and subtextual decisions made during scenes in Spielberg’s Minority Report, Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, and Inarritu’s Birdman. 

Film directors have to juggle the script, the talent, the camera, staging, blocking, and they’re responsible for every creative decision on a movie or television show. This video essay and film analysis will go over blocking in film, composition in film, and teach you some of the most important lessons you can learn on how to direct actors and staging your scenes. 

Our filmmaking tips will help you build better scenes that convey an idea to the viewer while also entertaining the viewer. Our video will show you how to shoot and direct a scene like Spielberg’s Minority Report, Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, and Inarritu’s Birdman. 

This lesson is like a free online film school that covers composition in art, directing movies, Filmmaking tips, blocking in film, composition in film, and how to direct actors. By the end you’ll have a better idea on how to direct a scene and movie like the masters.

mGDieKE1_ZI,Amazon’s The Boys — How Production Design is a Superpower,2019-09-30 11:00:08+00:00,"Production Design in The Boys ►► http://bit.ly/2lLKfBP

Today’s video is a filmmaking video essay on Amazon Prime video’s new show, The Boys. Our film theory and scene analysis on the scene elements and production design used in The Boys. This can include set dressing, movie props, and costumes. 

Have you watched The Boys on Amazon prime video? We have, and we were excited when we heard that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were producers on the show. We were also excited to hear about The Boys cast which includes Jack Quaid. 

Many had never even heard of The Boys comic, so when the first season of  The Boys show came out, it was a total blindside. We found something else about the show that is really great — mise en scene. Mise en scene includes many things like scene elements and production design, and we found that The Boys did a great job at building a world. 

The Boys had to choose production design and scene elements that were both satirical but also logical, and they needed to build a world that seemed legitimate. This includes the costumes, the movie props, the set dressing — all of the scene elements and mise en scene had to help show the difference in characters, in their circumstances, etc.

Out video teaches you about mise en scene, production design, and scene elements through our video essay on The Boys on Amazon prime video. Make sure to check it out so you can level up your own filmmaking skills with our scene analysis. It will be fun to see if they continue the excellence in The Boys season 2.

In this video essay, we discuss a long-held belief in filmmaking theory how you can take your directing and filmmaking to the next level by building locations that serve as a character in your movie. This video essay will show you how setting can not only be a character in your movies, but it needs to be. When directing movies, you have to keep everything in mind in filmmaking which includes your film settings. 

The Friday Night Lights TV show uses the setting as character. When Pete Berg was directing the original Friday Night Lights movie, he knew this was the case, so he made sure to carry that over into the Friday Night Lights TV show. Filmmaking is all about a collection of decisions, and directing movies requires the director to use film settings as a character. 

In this film analysis video essay, you’ll learn:

How to write unique film settings.
How to film locations as a character. 
How to direct movies and up your filmmaking. 

This is something you might learn in film school, but when you do film analysis you’ll see how very few directors use their location as a character the way the Friday Night Lights TV show did. Directing movies isn’t easy, and it requires attention to details like film settings. 

Check out our film analysis video essay on one of the most important aspects of filmmaking: How to build filming locations and settings as a character.

N6grnNDRVOE,The DARK Humor of Yorgos Lanthimos — Dark Comedy in The Lobster Explained,2019-09-16 14:30:00+00:00,"Dark Comedy Examples ►► http://bit.ly/34EKNuQ

In this video essay, we’re going to discuss the dark humor in The Lobster, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. What is dark humor and how does Lanthimos make it so uncomfortable to laugh? Our video essay will give you some film analysis and filmmaking theory that shows why Yorgos Lanthimos films are some of the smartest and dark movies around. This is The Lobster explained.

How do you go about directing a movie like The Lobster, which such pitch-black humor? How do you get the cast in the right frame of mind? This seemed to be the case for Yorgos Lanthimos when he directed The Lobster with actors Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Colman, Ben Wishaw, and John C. Reilly bringing stellar performances that breathe life into the concept of dark humor. 

After directing The Lobster, Yorgos Lanthimos went on the direct the Academy Award-nominated film The Favourite, which has since cemented Yorgos Lanthimos movies as must-see films, and Lanthimos as a director is now seen as royalty in the world of dark humor (or dark humour if you’re British).  

Our video essay not only talks about the filmmaking theory but also gives you some filmmaking tips and scene analysis that you can use to level up your dark comedy movies. If you need inspiration on writing and directing dark humor, look no further than Yorgos Lanthimos’ uncomfortably hilarious The Lobster.

Christopher Nolan is one of the few filmmakers directing today who make films that need to be shown in IMAX. He takes filmmaking theory to a whole other level. 

Our Video Essay will do a deep film analysis of Christopher Nolan movies, but instead of touching on his directing style or filmmaking tips, we’re going to look at the constant motif in his films — the use of the circle. Will his new film Tenet have that same modern film noir style that we’ve seen during Christopher Nolan’s directing career? 

Christopher Nolan movies encapsulate the essence of filmmaking. They show how an intelligent person can become begin directing movies and become successful without the need for film school. He uses philosophy to define his films and takes us into areas of science fiction and thriller that most directors can’t seem to achieve.

npwCkNEjCbU,What’s in the Box? — Recreating Se7en’s Climax for $400,2019-09-02 14:30:06+00:00,"Low Budget Filmmaking Tips ►► http://bit.ly/2MPEf78
Free Budget Template ►► http://bit.ly/2MLnZ6V
Free LUT Pack ►► http://bit.ly/2NLsy0S

How can you make low budget filmmaking work? How can you make no-budget filmmaking work? What about no-budget filmmaking of a high budget scene? What's in the box?

In this video, we set out to recreate the ending scene in the David Fincher movie, Se7en. The Se7en ending scene has the famous Brad Pitt line, “What’s in the box?”. We put our guerilla filmmaking hats on to show you the filmmaking process. This DIY filmmaking video will show you how you don't need a big film budget to get a cinematic look. Here's our shopping cart list of film gear we used:

Black Magic Cinema Camera 4K | $75
Canon 16 - 35mm f/2.8 | $20
Canon 70 - 200mm f/2.8 | $20
DJI Mavic Pro 4K | $50
4' Rhino Slider | $20
Neewer 5 in 1 Reflector | $20
Dracast LED | $13

How can you apply low budget filmmaking to the Se7en ending scene that had a film budget in the tens of millions of dollars? How can you get the film look that David Fincher films have when you’re working on an ultra-low budget or even no-budget filmmaking. The DIY filmmaking process relies on calling in favors, but there are other guerrilla techniques that can make your micro-budget film work. 

When you’re not spending millions to cast John Doe you can do more with your micro-budget. We walk you through the steps along with a film budget breakdown to show how we made the Se7en ending scene with low budget filmmaking in mind. 

The Se7en movie ending took David Fincher weeks to film and hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even they didn’t get everything right from a video production process standpoint, but they made the ""What' in the box?"" scene work. We were able to film the Se7en ending for a fraction of the cost.

The end result: You will learn low budget filmmaking techniques that will help you take your micro-budget, ultra low budget, or even no-budget guerrilla film to the next level.

Have you ever watched the suspense thriller, The Ring? It’s one of those horror movies that changed suspense movies for a while and launched the directing career of Gore Verbinski. Was it the story that made it so effective? Or was it the mastering of shot composition?

We apply some filmmaking theory along with basic directing principles that you learn in film school to see if one of the best filmmaking tools you can ever use is your shot composition. Shot Composition seems simple, but it dictates everything including how you edit scenes, how you show the viewer information, and what they cannot see. 

Directing movies only gets easier once you unlock the power of shot composition, and this video essay and film analysis will help you to build suspense in a horror movie, suspense thriller, or even that satirical scene in your comedy project. This is film school for directors who want to keep their viewers guessing. 

If you want to learn more about the filmmaking process, how to build suspense, and how your directing career starts with shot composition, you need to watch this video essay, film analysis, and breakdown of filmmaking theory on The Ring.

YIINChTTyhs,"How Alfonso Cuaron Motivates Camera Movements — ""Car Chase"" Long Take  (Children of Men)",2019-08-12 14:30:01+00:00,"Alfonso Cuaron Directing Tips ►► http://bit.ly/2KnZyu1

When directing a film you have a lot of choices to make, and that includes your scene length and tone created by camera movement and placement. 

Our video essay will discuss how Alfonso Cuarón motivates his camera movement during the car chase long take in Children of Men. A long take is a continuous camera shot, also known as a ‘oner’. While they’re continuous, it doesn’t mean you won’t still have some editing to do in the final cut of your film. A ""motivated camera movement"" is when there is a narrative reasoning for why a camera moves so ""hide"" the movement and not break the fourth wall. This is often achieved by having a subject or object in the frame as a motivator for the camera to follow. 

Cuaron does an excellent job mashing up long takes and motivated camera movement to create a seamless viewing experience in Children of Men.

They also happen to be one of the most discussed shot types in film that you and your peers will discuss in film school, and they’re a great topic for discussing filmmaking theory. Long takes also happen to be a trademark of Alfonso Cuarón films. 

It’s a mixture of Alfonso Cuarón’s filmmaking process and Emmanuel Lubeski cinematography that forced the team to put the camera in the car and create filmmaking tools and a camera rig that gave the 360 movements that made the whole scene work. 

Filmmaking choices like this can make or break your directing career. Watch as our team breaks down the long takes from Children of Men so that you can see how motivated camera work can help you build an unforgettable one in your next project.

It’s no secret that having great characters in movies is one way to get your story noticed - that’s why character archetypes are such a useful and powerful tool for any writer. 

Regardless of whether you’re a seasoned vet or just learning how to write your screenplay, character archetypes help writers create dynamic character relationships and set the foundation for great character development and character traits. 

In this series, we’ll break down eight essential and original character archetypes in movies who will add drama, tension, or comedy to any story you write. 

In episode two of our Character Archetype series, we’re going to cover the one we like to call, “The Caregiver.” 

Generous and open-hearted, these character traits tell us that the Caregiver is typically the kind supportive friend. A character archetype to lean on, encourage, and a great tool to use when learning how to write a screenplay, character development, and character traits.

Think C-3PO from Star Wars, Albert from the Batman series. Sam from Lord of the Rings and Ron from Harry Potter. These characters are ubiquitous in film and TV, even if you’re not writing an epic action/adventure story.

Want to make the viewer clamp up and think, “Oh no, not them?” Develop a great character archetype like the caregiver and then put them in harm’s way. Because they’re so generous with their time and emotions to our heroes, it’s often they are targets for villains.

By the end of this video, you will have a better understanding for how character archetypes can help that great idea you have for a story, and transform it into a produced script.

rR6C2YDqdgg,How the Coen Brothers Shoot Insert Shots (Insert Shot Examples from The Big Lebowski),2019-06-17 14:30:02+00:00,"Give your viewer more insight with an Insert Shot ►► http://bit.ly/2KiB4n8

An “insert shot” (AKA “insert”) is a shot that focuses on a specific detail within a scene. 

Inserts often involve an object or set of objects, often from a character's POV, but you can film inserts many different ways. 

In some cases, they can be filmed with a body double or even the second unit. 

Inserts are not one size fits all despite having such a general label. 

In this video, we’re going to analyze how to write, film, and edit insert shots by breaking down a number of important inserts in one of the greatest films of all time, The Big Lebowski, written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. 

Coen brother movies are so good we tend to forget how they do the little thing really well, and one of those simple things is the insert shot. We go over some important principles you need to keep in mind when planning, filming, and cutting your insert shots.

They are:

Composition

Color

Time

Understanding how to craft inserts using these three aspects will allow you to build scenes more effectively because important scene details will be shown in a way that provides both clarity and an emotional context for how the information needs to be received.
  
Insert shots may seem like a simple, quick thing you blaze through on set - but they are just as important as any other shot you will get. Don’t underestimate them.

After you watch this video, you will have a better idea on how to go about planning, filming, and using your insert shots in your next film or project - just like the Coen brothers.

GbKiMJRVyg4,How to Shoot a Michael Bay 360 Hero Shot [Michael Bay’s Directing Style Explained],2019-06-10 14:30:00+00:00,"The 360-Degree Tracking Shot in Michael Bay Movies ►► http://bit.ly/2JJ4A5g

Michael Bay movies are some of the most popular in today’s world of cinema, and a big part of this is his style of directing and the build of his camera shots. 

When Michael Bay directs a film like any of the Transformers or Bad Boys movies, he tends to use a specific shot that builds up his characters - they call it the Michael Bay hero shot. 

To have an entire camera shot and technique named after you is no small feat, and Michael Bay has earned this particular camera shot by using it at moments that seem to resonate audiences around the world. Michael Bay movies work really well for a reason.

In this video, we set out to recreate the Michael Bay camera shot that has become so famous, and break down Michael Bay films and directing style. 

Things you’ll learn:

How to use camera movement during the Michael Bay camera shot

How to build actor movement during the Michael Bay camera shot

Which lenses to use during the Michael Bay camera shot

We didn’t splurge on explosions or many of the other Micahel Bay movie staples, but we did build a pretty great spinning hero shot just like Michael Bay.

Go behind the scenes with us to see this technique used in all of the Transformers movies. Are you excited for Bad Boys 3? Then you’ll love our video. 

If you have a camera, an actor, and some ambitions you can go out and create a Micahel Bay camera shots tomorrow, and we hope our directing technique video helps. 

The end result: You will know how to direct a Michael Bay camera shot and build your own visual style like the director of Transformers and Bad Boys.

You might wonder how to make a shot list for your next film or video project. 

Have you been looking at shot list examples and shot list templates for so long now that your eyes are starting to dry out? That is not how a shot list app should work. 

Don’t worry, you’re not alone.

Creating a shot list for a film is an important way to visualize and plan all the shots you will need to capture to make sure you don’t have gaps in your edit. There is nothing more frustrating and expensive than doing a reshoot, especially when it was avoidable. 

Tagging elements for your script and identifying the shots you’ve visualized is just part of the puzzle, but there is more that goes into planning your scene. You don’t need shot list samples, what you really need is an intuitive pre-production software like StudioBinder. 

StudioBinder’s Shot List software allows you to even upload custom images as a reference point and automatically tags essential elements during your breakdown. 

You can also custom label elements that are specific to your scenes.

It takes care of the shot list format for you and keeps you focused on the creativity of your scenes rather than distracting you. You can create a shot list in StudioBinder, share with collaborators, have them comment on your shot list, and pick up where you left off.

A shot list is one of the most important documents they will ever make because it makes up a plan of visual goals the production team much achieve before the clock runs out.
 
StudioBinder is more than a shot list app - it’s a full pre-production solution. 

Throw away that shot list template that you made with Google Docs, or worse, Excel, and get started creating your perfect shot list today.

ZhYvs7rrGnw,Art of the Whip Pan Shot: Motivating Your Swish Pan Effects & Transitions #whippan #swishpan,2019-05-06 14:30:01+00:00,"The Whip Pan Effect ►► http://bit.ly/2LnYkBr

A whip pan, swish pan, or whip shot happens when you very quickly rotate your camera on the x-axis, and this results in both a blurring effect and a neutral shot.

In this video, we give you the whip pan definition, show you tons of whip pan transitions, and whip pan examples from popular films and television shows including Whiplash, Sherlock Holmes, La La Land, Boogie Nights, Lord of The Rings, Kill Bill, and a number of other films that used the whip pan well. 

Whip pans are used for:

Energy

Transitions

Cause and Effect

Whip pans can be used to simply generate some energy into your scenes, used for scene transitions, or to show cause and effect within a scene. It doesn’t matter if you use Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Final Cut Pro, or any NLE - you can build whip pans. 

You can use a whip pan for your action sequences, especially to simulate the motion of a flying object. Combine this with some clever make-up and a whip pan sound effect, and you can build a great moment in your fight scenes.

Whip pans seem like a tiny little speck on the filmmaking toolbelt, but they are super effective and one of the earliest techniques that a good filmmaker will want to learn. 

You can simulate whip pans in after effects like many video influencers.  

After you watch this video, you will have a better idea on how to go about planning, filming, and using whip pans in your next movie, show, or project.

Using visual motif in film is one of the quickest ways to show your directing prowess as a filmmaker in 2019, but applying motif in movies is easier said than done. If film school will teach you anything, it is that directing a film starts with your theme. 

This video will give you the motif definition and motif examples so that you can use visual motif in film just like director Jonathan Demme in The Silence of the Lambs. As a filmmaker, Demme understands the motif meaning, and how it needs to support your theme. 

Things you’ll learn about motif in film:

Visual motif in film definition for directing and filmmaking
Examples of visual motif in The Silence of the Lambs
Visual motif in film meaning and theme

In addition, we’ll teach you how you can use filmmaking, directing techniques, and your film production team to build visual motifs in your film. Learn from these motif examples.

The Silence of the Lambs took full use of every department to build visual and audio motif in the film. Hannibal Lecter, Buffalo Bill, Clarice Starling - all of these character from The Silence of the Lambs were part of the American visual motif in this Oscar-winning film.

It’s no secret that having great characters is a hallmark of an amazing story - that’s why character archetypes are such a useful and powerful tool for any writer. 

Regardless of whether you’re a seasoned vet or just writing your first script, character archetypes help writers create dynamic character relationships and set the foundation for great development. 

In this series, we’ll break down eight essential and original character archetypes who will add drama, tension, or comedy to whatever story you’re writing. 

Our first episode is The Leader.

After all, what is Game of Thrones without Jon Snow?

We’ll examine their strengths, weaknesses, ideas for occupations and context, as well as which other archetypes they pair well with - and which ones they don’t. People will say your characters be popping off the page in no time. 

Let’s consider your script like a dinner and these characters are the ingredients. How you use them, the frequency, and interaction with one another is what makes the dinner memorable or... regrettable. 

By the end of this video, you will have a better understanding for how character archetypes can help that great idea you have for a story, and transform it into a produced script.

In today’s video, we’re going to break down one of the most important directing techniques for any type of filmmaker, and then show you how Steven Spielberg used it all throughout the Oscar-winning film, Schindler’s List. 

The great Walter Murch has dubbed this advanced directing technique, Eye trace. 
Eye trace is a fancy term for directing the eyes of the viewer to certain portions of your frame through the use of a few different helpful methods.

Motion

Positioning

Color

Film directors need to guide the viewer to look at certain things at the correct moment, because part of telling a compelling story is taking everyone on the same ride at the same time so that we can all feel that shared experience.

Spielberg uses eye trace in each of his films, and he applies this masterfully in Schindler’s List. The film won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, and a big part of that was Spielberg’s use of eye trace. 

He also kept the film grounded, and avoided the use of technocranes. This thoughtful visual approach reinforces the theme of the film and guides the viewer through the story. 

When you finish this video, you will see how a great director like Steven Spielberg keeps his audience on the same page, directs your eyes to where they need to be, and how he uses visuals to support the subject matter and theme of his greatest film, Schindler’s List. 

The end result: You will know some helpful methods for applying the most important cinematic technique for directors and editors.

uYintvFe_Ys,Rules of Shot Composition: How Nightcrawler Creates Empathy with Eyes #antiheroexamples,2019-04-01 14:30:03+00:00,"Using Rules of Composition to Create Empathy with Eyes ►► http://bit.ly/2WsPvGY

In today’s video, we’re going to talk about the effect you gain from showing or hiding the eyes of a character, and how your shot selection the rules of composition can help you to build empathy for an anti-hero.  

A character’s eyes are one of the first things we connect with as a viewer. The more exposed they are, the more we see them as human. The more hidden they are, the more we ignore their humanity. 

In short, a character’s eyes are the window to the soul. 

When filmmakers want someone to see something, they align the subject or object so that it rests on an area of the frame where vectors cross. These vectors are most commonly cut into “thirds” hence the name the rule of thirds or rules of composition.

If your goal is to show the eyes of your character so that your visuals may build empathy, it makes sense to have those eyes land in line with the rules of composition. 

Great filmmakers know that their shot composition is one of the most important parts of filmmaking, and it doesn’t change for the eyes. This is a deep psychological truth that goes beyond film and television, but what is so great about video compared to a stage play is that we can actually see the actor’s eyes.  

You can use film lighting techniques, your costume department, film blocking, shot composition, and the rules of composition to show or hide the eyes of your characters, and in turn, choose how the viewer will absorb the energy of your characters.

We use Dan Gilroy’s Nightcrawler and Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom to show how filmmaking techniques and actor performance can shape your view of a character. 

In this video on Nightcrawler, we’ll go over:
- Shot selection to show or hide the eyes
- Film lighting to show or hide the eyes
- Presentation of the eyes

When you finish, you will see how Dan Gilroy wanted to present Lou in as neutrally as possible, and how he kept the eyes of Lou Blooms as part of the fabric of his film.

The end result: You will know when to hide, and when to show a character's eyes.

In today’s video, we’re going to show you how to plan and film the best car chase scene. Car chase scenes in movies are a staple, and we thought we’d use one of the best car chase examples from the last decade - Mad Max: Fury Road. 

Filming a great car chase takes more than just story beats and elaborate stunts. That’s easy enough to say, but what makes this chase scene from Mad Max: Fury Road one of the best car chase scenes ever? 

Answer: They used filmmaking techniques to their full potential. 

Screen direction, 180-degree rule, basic camera movement, and the rule of thirds all need to be paid attention to if you want to make sure that your viewer will track and comprehend the events taking place. 

That’s what George Miller does in Mad Max: Fury Road, and it is why that film is absolutely one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made. His team got a ton of footage and then laced it all together through direction and editing. 

In this video on car chases from Mad Max: Fury Road, we’ll go over:

Shot selection in high energy sequences

Screen direction and how to reorient the camera

Stable footage used during a particularly kinetic sequence

When you finish, you will see how a great director like George Miller plans out his car chase scenes, and how you can apply those lessons to your own film. 

The end result: You will be able to build amazing car chase scenes that also tell a story.

In today’s video, we’re going to take a look one of the most commonly used shots in film and television: The over-the-shoulder shot.

The over-the-shoulder shot (OTS) seems simple enough, seeing as the definition is in the name, but it is often used without the proper cinematic motivation.

It is true that you gain a sense of orientation by having a character’s shoulder in the frame, but there is also a significant psychological effect, and therefore significant emotions generated when you use an over-the-shoulder shot in film or television. 

It might seem a bit trivial, but all of these little decisions add up to an effective, or ineffective storytelling experience. Oh, and you don’t have to exclusively use over-the-shoulder shots for dialogue scenes either.  

Our video shows you:

Examples of over-the-shoulder shots.

Why you use an OTS shot in your story.

AND

How to go about surrounding your OTS shots.
 
When you finish this video, you will have a complete understanding of when, where, how, and why you use an OTS shot, and you’ll be able to use them to their maximum effect. 

The end result: You will be able to signal to your viewer how they should feel about a relationship within your story.

Our video breaks down: 

Which questions to ask.

Who to bring. 

What to look for.

AND

How to get the most out of your tech scout. 

Our video features key crew member each with their own unique job duties and perspective on the tech scout. Understanding what each department looks for will make you a more complete producer and filmmaker. 

When you finish this video, you will understand everything you need to know about location tech scouts and how they are different from your initial location scout.

The 180 Degree Rule in Film ►► http://bit.ly/180-Degree-Rule-in-Film

The 180 degree line is a rule used in filmmaking that helps you maintain a constant orientation during your scenes. That said, there are ways you can break the 180 degree rule, and ways that you can bend the 180 degree rule.

Our video breaks down how to follow the 180 degree rule, how to break the 180 degree rule, and bend the 180 degree rule to achieve maximum effectiveness from your scene.

Breaking the 180 degree rule can also be called crossing the line or jumping the line. The line you draw connects two actors in a scene, and once you’ve established your camera placement on one side of the line, you have now decided which 180 degrees you will have to place your subsequent camera setups.

You do this so that your viewer can keep their orientation, and avoid spatial confusion.

But what if you break the line?

We show specific examples of directors and films that follow the 180 degree rule, break the 180 degree rule, and bend the 180 degree rule so that you understand perfectly the different effects each has on a viewer.

When you finish this video, you will understand why you need to follow the 180 degree rule in most situations, and know exactly when you should break it or bend it. 

The end result: You will understand the 180 degree rule better than you did before - and how to command your visuals.

What is a shot list? A shot list is the best way to organize your visual goals for your scenes. That said, there are an infinite amount of choices for different shots, and not all shot lists include the necessary information needed to get the intended visuals.

Our video uses our shot list creator to break down a shot list, and explain the purpose behind it so that you understand why you need to build a shot list for your scenes.  

You’ll also learn about the basic types of camera shots, why you will want to choose specific shots, and how you can accurately label each shot during the creation of your shot list. 

We also go over how your shot list can be used long before your scene is captured, as well as after the scene is already finished. How it can help everyone on your team including the editor, cinematographer, and especially the director. 

When you finish this video, you will understand why shot lists are so valuable, and that building an effective shot list is one of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. 
You can also create a free shot list using our shot list template at the end.

The end result: You will understand shot lists better than you did before, and be on your way to building your own professional shot list.

You might wonder how to create a shot list for your next film or video project. 

Have you been looking at shot list examples and shot list templates for so long now that your eyes are starting to dry out? 

Don’t worry, you’re not alone.

Creating a shot list for a film is an important way to visualize and plan all the shots you will need to capture to make sure you don’t have gaps in your edit. There is nothing more frustrating and expensive than doing a reshoot, especially when it was avoidable. 

Tagging elements for your script and identifying the shots you’ve visualized is just part f the puzzle, but there is more that goes into planning your scene. You don’t need shot list samples, what you really need is an intuitive pre-production software like StudioBinder. 

StudioBinder’s Shot List software allows you to even upload custom images as a reference point and automatically tags essential elements during your breakdown. You can also custom label elements that are specific to your scenes.

It takes care of the shot list format for you, and keeps you focused on the creativity of your scenes rather than distracting you. You can create a shot list in StudioBinder, share with collaborators, have them comment on your shot list, and pick up where you left off.

StudioBinder is more than a shot list app - it’s a full pre-production solution. 

Throw away that shot list template that you made with Google Docs, or worse, Excel, and get started creating your perfect shot list today.

T0YHA2yxCwM,Aspect Ratios in Film: How to Choose The Most Cinematic Aspect Ratio #aspectratio,2018-12-03 17:57:00+00:00,"Create your FREE Shot List ►► http://bit.ly/2PdG2zs

In today’s essay on video production, we break down aspect ratios, and jump into the current aspect ratios for video, film, TV, and the internet.

What does aspect ratio mean? We give you a clear aspect ratio definition.

So whether you’re curious about aspect ratio 16 9 or aspect ratio 4 3, you’ll know more than you did before, and feel confident going forward.

Then, we help you figure out which aspect ratio is best for your next project.

Understand this filmmaking technique so that you can use it creatively in 2019!

Aspect ratios are the ratio of width to height that describes the shape of your filmed image.

2.35:1, is an aspect ratio that was introduced in the ‘50s as Cinemascope. It’s really wide, and you’ve probably seen it in westerns, grand adventures and historical epics.

1.85:1 is a slightly narrower aspect ratio. It was also introduced in the ‘50s, and is most commonly seen in dramas and comedies - but - it can appear in just about any genre.

New digital standards introduce another aspect ratio to consider - 1.78:1, otherwise known as 16x9. This is the standard aspect ratio for television, and it’s the default for many web-based video players.

Before you shoot a frame of your movie, you need to decide what aspect ratio use.

First, study the playing field. What do other films in your genre typically do?

Comedies are usually taller, so you can get your comedic wide shots without feeling like you’re too far away from your characters. Dramas are also usually shot taller, so close-ups can be more intimate.

Adventures, sweeping epics, and stories that feature a striking or dramatic landscape tend to be shot very wide, so that even in a close-up, the setting remains present on-screen.

Next, consider the level of realism you’re trying to achieve. Do you want people to respond to your film as fact or fantasy?

Of the popular aspect ratios, the taller ones like 1.85 match our optical field of view more closely than does cinemascope. If you’re telling a gritty crime drama, you might want your image to approximate what we see in the real world.

But if you’re telling a fantasy narrative, it might help to present it with a wider image - something that differs from how we normally see the world. 

Your next step is to consider the setting of your story. 
In some stories, the setting is really important. For those, you should choose an aspect ratio that best captures that setting, especially when you’ve got a character in the shot.

This doesn’t always mean going for the widest aspect ratio possible.

If you’ve got a film where the tall buildings of a big city play heavily into your story, you might want to consider a taller frame to capture that feeling.

We go even further in the video, so watch and learn more about aspect ratios today.

What is a line producer? In this video, we’ll explore every aspect of the line producer job description. 

From breaking down the script in pre-production to wrapping and prepping for post-production, line producers have key responsibilities in every phase of production.

If you want an easy-to-understand line producer definition, this video delivers. The line producer needs to know the above-the-line and below-the-line costs of a project. A line producer also handles any insurance claims that arise during the project.

A line producer will break down the script into an initial budget and shooting schedule. The line producer job description includes estimating the cost of each shooting day, overseeing the hiring of crew, and negotiating with vendors.

For those wondering how to become a line producer, maintaining diplomatic and clear communication channels is key. So is staying organized at every step of the production process.

Returning production gear and securing post-production personnel and facilities falls to the line producer. Line producers and assistant line producers know it’s not if something will go wrong, but when. 

Putting out fires is a major part of the line producer job description.
In pre-production, the line producer has to channel everyone’s excitement and get the ball rolling. This involves setting up a production company for the project. 

It also involves breaking down every element of the script that impacts production, planning a detailed budget, and planning for contingencies. 

The line producer salary and responsibilities are often closely guarded secrets in Hollywood, but we unlock those secrets. We’ll share in this video how a line producer interacts with producers, assistant line producers, and other cast and crew members.

If you watch this video, in no time you’ll be able to summarize a solid line producer job description. You’ll understand the film, television, commercial, and video production process with new insight and understanding.

What is a rack focus? A rack focus is a technique in filmmaking and cinematography where you adjust the focus of your lens to show something that was, at first, indistinguishable.

The difference between a rack focus and a focus pull is the degree of visibility.

Focus pulling is supposed to remain invisible so as to keep you in the story…

But racking focus needs to be more apparent to draw the attention of the viewer.

A rack focus in a film should reveal some crucial piece of information, or signal a big change in the scene - something you cannot achieve with an invisible focus pull. That is why the rack focus is such a unique focus pulling technique. 

We show you examples of the rack focus in several films and break down how they were used in Casino Royale (2006) directed by Martin Campbell.

In today’s essay on video production, we give you the rack focus definition and show you various rack focus examples so that you can see how the pros wield this advanced filmmaking technique.

Then we break it down so that you can have a great rack focus in your next project. 

Understand this technique so that you can use it in 2019!

You want to know how to rack focus. Maybe even a rack focus tutorial. Racking focus is as simple placing subjects in frame at varying depth, marking the focus distances on your lens, and then pulling at the opportune moment. You don’t even have to rack focus very fast if you don’t want to, especially if you’re using it as a POV shot of someone waking up.

You can also use a rack focus to visually illustrate a character processing information.

That’s because they are used by thoughtful filmmakers who understand that less can be more when you know what you’re doing.

Using the rack focus in special ways can also be an opportunity to build your own visual style, and to tell the audience something they didn’t know just moments before.

What do you gain from using a rack focus?

Rack focus gives you Focused Direction - control the eyes of the viewer.

Rack focus gives you Layered images - have subjects at varying depths.

Rack focus gives you Visual Storytelling - show reactions to things on, and off screen.

Rack focus gives you Economic filmmaking - save time and money with fewer shots.

Rack focus gives you Emotional connection - make your link from ‘A’ to ‘B’ more profound.

In today’s essay on video production, we give you a budget breakdown and show you how Wes Anderson used creative budgeting to film The Grand Budapest 

This video will help you understand how to creatively budget for your next project.

Indie films have pros and cons like anything else. You don’t have to answer to big corporate studios as much, but you have less money as a consequence.

Why do some directors prefer the control over their films more than extra money?

That’s because they have figured out a way to achieve their narrative and visual goals within a limited budget. When you know how to creatively use your money and department heads, you actually improve the energy behind the film while also helping out your producers. 

We show you examples of how Wes Anderson did this on The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film ended up having the best box office haul of any independent film.

There are many reasons for this that extend beyond the creative use of the budget, but the quality of the actual film very much relied on creative budgeting. Quality and success go hand in hand with independent features.

If the audience is disappointed with their experience, they won't recommend the film to their family and friends.

Wes Anderson used miniatures, matte paintings, and creative camera rigs to film many of the high budget scenes, and this allowed him to achieve a mega-budget look with an independent price tag.

Your project can gain more production value from creativity than it can from simple gear, because manufacturers have no idea what you need for your specific project, and doing something that no one has ever seen before is more valuable than a hundred cookie-cutter projects with good lighting.

Check out the video so you can see exactly what we mean!

In today’s essay on video production, we give you a modern tracking shot definition and show you various tracking shot examples, including some of the best tracking shots and dolly shots.

Then we break down how you can build your own effective tracking shot for your next project. 

Perfect this technique so that you can use it in 2019!

If you’re like us, you LOVE a good tracking shot. 

That’s because there are so many different ways to do them, and that gives filmmakers an opportunity to build their own visual style through the use of a complex tracking shot or dolly shot.

We show you examples of tracking shots in movies, and then break down some of the really important creative decisions to keep in mind when planning your own tracking shot.

Then we discuss how to approach the camera movement in your tracking shot or dolly shot.  

The 3 things to keep in mind are:

1. Location - How does your location help you create an interesting tracking shot? It should play a huge part, both from a visual and narrative standpoint and if your location is a character itself, even better. You want to find a location with some columns or angles that facilitate a big reveal. 

2. Production Design - Location is all about the ‘what was there before, and what will be there after’. Production Design is about what you create and what you bring. Want to do a particularly difficult and mind-boggling tracking shot? Consider using a clever production design to achieve your goals. 

3. Blocking - How you move principal and background actors in your scene can take your tracking shot to the next level. That’s because you can use them to motivate camera movement, to keep up energy, to make statements, to generate subtext, or to drive the story forward. 
What about Camera Movement?

How you move your camera is the last element of your tracking shot:

1. Speed - This is how quickly your camera moves throughout the scene. If you are moving rather quickly, you will likely create a more energetic pace for your scene. You can use camera speed to contradict the content of the scene to evoke some seriously confusing emotions in the viewer.

2. Stability - How stable your camera is will have a direct effect on how the viewer digests the visual information on the screen. If the camera is super smooth, it might help you generate confidence in the viewer. If your camera is shakey, it may reinforce the dire circumstances of your scene.

3. Duration - Duration is how long your actual scene runs. If you want to tire your audience out or create a sense of endlessness, have your tracking shot go super long. Want to get through information quickly? Send it bro! No rules - just results. Just don’t be boring!

We go even further in the video, so start watching and learn more about tracking shots today!

That way, you can add this technique to your cinematic arsenal for 2019. 

Most everyone loves a good long take. They have an undeniable energy that is hard to replicate, and they’ve become the favorite for many modern filmmakers. 

Many Oscar-winning films in the last five years have made long takes their visual theme.

Not every long take is created equally, and there are some simple steps you can take before, during, and after you record your own opulent long take.

There are 3 different story elements that you can affect with a long take:

1. Character long takes occur when this cinematic technique puts us in the shoes of a specific character or set of characters in a scene. It doesn’t always have to be our hero, and the main idea is to film your scene so that we feel the emotions that the characters are feeling.

2. Setting long takes occur when we are transported to the physical location in the scene. We need to feel as if we are there, walking through the street, or around the property, or along the beach. Take us on a journey. 

3. Plot long takes occur when this cinematic technique places us into the emotional context of the plot in a scene. We need to feel an omniscient sense of connection to a particular chain of events that is leading us toward our eventual narrative destination. 

We go even further in the video, so start watching and learn more about long takes today!

KdWdlM9x9l4,How to Achieve a Cinematic Film Look [Sidney Lumet Making Movies],2018-10-22 14:00:03+00:00,"Get Your FREE Cinematography Techniques Guide 👉👉 http://bit.ly/2S7yAbV

How do you achieve a cinematic film look for your film? It's actually not as hard as you might think.

You’ve come to the right place.

In today’s video, we explain what Sidney Lumet calls, The Lens Plot.

We define this advanced cinematic technique, and provide specific examples from popular films so that you can generate the perfect lens plot for your own project. 

Add this skill to your cinematic arsenal for 2019. 

A lens plot is sort of like a stylesheet for your lens and lighting. It is used by establishing a visual motif specifically through your camera lenses. It takes more than LUTs and color grading to get the film look. 

A big part of that is your lens plot.

“It’s a way to make sure that your shots serve your story as a whole.”

There are 3 different types of lens plots:

1. Static lens plot refers to constant, enchanted visuals throughout a particular project or film.

2. Narrative lens plot refers to visuals that gradually change over the course of a story. 

3. Elemental lens plot refers to a visuals that change with each character or story in a film.

To get this cinematic film look, you’ll want to first analyze your story. Is it a fluffy comedy, or a dark journey into the mind of a psychopath? 

What lens would work well in each situation?

Once you’ve determined what your story is about, and the effects of different lenses, then you can build a lens plot that visually conveys the tone, world, and feel of your story.

A good director won’t force a specific cinematic look unless it enhances their story. A good producer will keep this in mind as well. If you’re a cinematographer, this might be a big part of your job - and it isn’t a bad thing to suggest to the director during the planning stages.

You will have a hard time establishing yourself as an auteur without this advanced film technique, and you will have a harder time getting that cinematic look you desire.

We break it down step-by-step just for you. 

So enjoy our video and get your cinematic film took today!

In today’s video, we explain a high angle shot definition and we show you the best high angle shot examples that range from subtle to extreme, and we break down when you should use one of the most versatile shots from you list of camera angles.

We’ll also break down the different emotions one can elicit with the high camera angle.

That way, you can add this camera technique to your cinematic arsenal for 2018.

If you’ve ever had a desire to improve your filmmaking, you will want to pay attention to the various camera angles that can be used during a scene. You cannot list the types of camera angles without the high angle camera shot.

Sad to say that the high angle camera shot is a severely underutilized camera angle in film.

As far as camera angles and shots go, a high angle shot is one of the best camera angles in filmmaking available to you. How you use it can make or break your scene.

There are 3 different types of high angle camera shots:

Narrative driven is a type of high angle camera shot that conveys information germane to the story. You can show off a location, or something you wouldn’t be able to see unless you had a high vantage point.

You want these to be as invisible as possible.

Emotionally driven high angle camera shots often make use of the visceral high angle shot.

This is used to induce a sense of vertigo, and danger in the viewer. The severity of the angle is one of the main differences, and its extreme nature makes us feel uneasy and anxious.

Character driven high angle camera shots are designed to make a character seem smaller, weaker, and more vulnerable. The idea is to place you inside a character who is in jeopardy, who is on the run, or in immediate danger.

We go even further in the video, so start watching and learn more about high angles today!

You've completed your series bible and finished the pilot script for your best show idea. Now you need a sizzle reel to help get you in the room and prove to producers that your idea should be their next project.

What is a sizzle reel?

A sizzle reel is a video that expresses the goals and the overall tone of your show or idea. This can be in the form of a short film, an important scene from your project, or a trailer.

It is one of the best ways to introduce your project. It can help you lock down meetings with producers and executives, and is one of the most effective tools during your pitch.

Don't go into the room empty-handed, just bring a sizzle reel.

This isn't a gimmick; it has become the best way to sell your show because no matter how good your idea might be, it is still a gamble.

Show them that with your idea, the odds are in their favor.

We've provided you with sizzle reel examples that turned ideas into reality so that you can begin to create a visual representation of why the time is now for your idea to be green-lit.

If you can create a compelling sizzle reel, your biggest problem won't be selling your show...

It will be deciding who buys it.

So you have your treatment,  pilot script and logline and you’re feeling ready to pitch your TV show to Netflix.

What we need to do is package all of your show elements into a pitch: something that is slick and glossy. Something that is just as impressive in the writer’s room as it is in the boardroom.

What we need is a show bible...

...And we’re going to show you exactly how to create one. 

In this episode of our TV Writing & Development Master Class, we’ll go over all the aspects that go into a great series bible and provide a FREE template for you to use when writing your own. We’ll dissect HBO’s Westworld and put it all together to show you how to use the template and what goes into an awesome series bible.

While there may be some confusion between series bible and pitch deck and what have you, they essentially boil down to the same thing: 

A document that showcases your vision for the show and where you plan to take it.

Writing a great series bible is key to getting in a room and pitching your show. It’s also key to the development and progression of your idea from pilot to series. Before you start sending your script around town, make sure you give this video a good watch.

You won’t want to take a meeting without first knowing how to make a great series bible!

In this video, Matt walks us through production on his latest campaign: How We Do Time for MVMT watches, and how he uses StudioBinder’s shot list feature to keep it all together.

What is a shot list?

Matt doesn't wait for the salt & sand to wash-off before planning his final cut. He starts his process by building a shot list template.

A shot list is a breakdown of the elements of each shot during production: timecode, shot, camera, shot size, equipment, lens and location. Shot lists are used to keep track of everything recorded during a shoot. They are also used to organize recorded footage for post-production sequencing.

You got a great script, now it’s time to start getting it read. In this video we’ll show you how to write a logline that sells.

It’s one thing to write a logline - everyone has one and execs read hundreds a day - but it’s another to write a great one. A logline that gets your script read, gets you in the room, and gets your show made.

Does it all come down to the logline? No, of course not. But it’s an incredibly useful tool that every writer should be able to master.

Loglines are used for a variety of things. From pitching an idea to development executives to those executives pitching the idea to investors to gain capital and funding for your script, everyone wants to read a logline.

As you move through the series and learn about how to frame and present your script, you’ll realize that much of it goes back to this simple sentence that helps sum up the entire idea.

The logline isn’t just a tool to get your script read, it’s the DNA sequence that everything beyond the script is made of. The logline is the genetic information that sets the basis for what your show is and what it’s about.

I think we can all agree that making a movie is hard work. Throw a few bumps in the road and it can get hectic. That’s where having a flexible shooting schedule comes in handy.

Today we’re going to go over one of the most insane movie productions ever, The Revenant, and show you how StudioBinder’s shooting schedule software can help you tame even the most wild production!

You’ll be able to use Shooting Schedule Stripboards to change things as your project moves forward. Even under the worst circumstances.

The Revenant is the story of “a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.”

That movie sounds grueling. But the shoot was equally as taxing.

The schedule was altered by lots of unforeseen factors. Weather, sickness, and unusable locations drastically altered this production.

It’s one thing to dream up ideas all day, it’s another to actually open the blank page and get it done: Here’s how to write a pilot script that sells.

We’ve covered our bases leading up to here by learning about whether an idea has legs, and what some of the key elements that go into a pilot are. Now it’s time to build on that foundation and start fleshing out an actual script. 

In this video, we’ll cover the outlining process using a technique developed by South Park creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Then we’ll use that solid structure to fill in the blanks. 

How are we gonna do this? By analyzing one of the best pilots of all time: Breaking Bad. 

With a show that well-written, there’s only room to learn and grow with every minute you spend dissecting and studying. 

With the structure provided by Parker and Stone, and the execution done by Vince Gilligan, we’ll walk you through a fool-proof way of outlining and writing your pilot. 

Your story will be strong enough to not only get “some heat,” as they say but get you in a room and pitching.

Got an idea with legs, but you’re unsure how to utilize your plans for character development? You’ve come to the right place. We have a free character profile template as well as lots of tips on how to make your pilot pop with excellent character development.

There are a few things to think about when you’re delving into creating a character profile.

WHO? 

It seems simple, but right off the bat we need to know who we're going to follow for the next 100 episodes. Let's start with our lead. Who are they on the outside? On the inside? What's the cast of characters look like and who populates the world?

WHAT?

Now that you know who's in the story, it's time to provide some backstory. What's happened to them that defines them? Do they have a secret past? Also, what's happening to them right now?

WHERE?

Are we in a border town in Arizona? Madison Avenue? Or Stars Hollow, Connecticut? Hey, Atlanta is a TV show about how its characters deal with an entire city!

When you're fleshing out your character development, take time to figure out how you can tell the deepest and most meaningful story possible.

It’s incredibly hard to make any movie, but a good movie? That’s nearly impossible.

But what if you made...a perfect movie? That’s what Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale did in 1985 when they released Back to the Future.

The movie is so funny, so charming, and so inspiring that it’s hard to imagine that at some point or another, the script was actually pretty bad.

So how did Back to the Future become the classic we know today?

They did a lot of reshoots.

Travel with us as we take you through Back to the Future. From first to final draft.

We’ll talk about what was added, taken away, and how if they had StudioBinder’s Script Breakdown software it would have been much easier on them.

Have you ever wondered about Color theory in Film? 

You film color palette matters to the audience. It’s not only aesthetic, it also affects storytelling. This video takes you through director’s choices when it comes to colorization in their film works and how those colors get different emotional responses from the audience.

We break down color in TV, movie, and use film theory to extract meaning from specific choices. There are three components of color.

They are:

Hue - which is the color. 

Saturation - the intensity of the color

Brightness - the brightness of the color

With just hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB for short) you can create a complex color scheme rather simply, and go from being just another director to a being a true visual artist.

By utilizing hue, saturation, and brightness you can precisely identify the right color create certain feelings in your audience.

Bright images often seem lively and exciting. Darker images often seem dramatic. And on it goes…

But rules were made to be broken.

What are some of your favorite moments of color in media and entertainment?

In this video essay, we’ll break down the wide shot in film and highlight how it went from a stock Hollywood shot to something more nuanced, and then back to a regularly used angle.

We’ll also discover ways you can use it in your own work to really amp up the tension, humor, and subtext of your plot. 

The wide shot is an expensive and laborious set-up, but this video will show you when and how to use one to make your story pop.   
When you’re working on a film or television idea it’s important to keep the word “scope” in mind. We’re talking world scope. Not the kind of scope you can capture with a drone.

Today we’re going to go over the Wide Shot, or Long Shot, and show you how it contributes to the scope of your story and can make your project better.

There’s lots you can do on the page, but what about when it comes time to shoot?

We’ll delve into Establishing Shots, Extreme Wide Shots, and talk about how they can actually accentuate character and theme without being overbearing on the story.

In episode 4 of our Filmmaking Techniques series, we’ll explore the director’s journey and how they collaborate with a cinematographer to create effective scenes that get emotion, excitement, and chills from the viewer. 

It’s important to remember we are following master directors, so whether you want to learn the basics or need to brush up on your already adequate skills, this series is for you.

We’ll go over the best shots and most effective shooting techniques so you can get started on your first or fortieth feature. These are the best movie shots ever in our opinion.

You’ll see work from Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, Paul Greengrass, and others.

Chances are some of your favorite shots in movie history involve movement of the camera. But not everything is a Paul Thomas Anderson oner or a Wes Anderson tracking shot. Sometimes movement is more subtle.

The ins and outs of cinematography and directing are nuanced. We have an entire series of these videos, so subscribe to the StudioBinder channel to find more free resources for you to use when crafting your next project.

eDSlJZeWT5Q,How to Film Fight Scenes: ‘Mission: Impossible Fallout’ Shot List,2018-07-26 14:30:01+00:00,"Today, we’re going to show you how to film fight scenes and shot list Mission: Impossible Fallout. Grab the FREE shot list from this video: http://bit.ly/2uQjTA1

When you shoot fight scenes it’s important to shot list and storyboard them carefully. You not only need this for the choreography, but to set the tone and mood of the fight.

This fight scene is frenetic. While only being 42 seconds long, there are 31 edits. We stay handheld for the entire fight to keep it feeling real.

The coverage here is intense. We not only get the hits, but we also get the reactions of the characters. It looks like they’re using a wide angle lens, and we alternate between low angle, high angle, and eye level shots.

Each department works in tandem here, collaborating to keep the scene visceral. Even the costume department gets in on the action, making Henry Cavill’s back sweaty. And let’s not even dive into how important his mustache is in this fight scene.

All together, we have an excellent fight scene that can inspire your next work. Make sure you shot list and storyboard your work before it happens.

9AGaECt9j4g,Film Blocking Tutorial — Filmmaking Techniques for Directors:  Ep3,2018-07-23 14:15:01+00:00,"In today's video, we'll cover key film blocking techniques that master directors use to create memorable scenes. Grab the FREE film blocking worksheet to stage scenes better: http://bit.ly/2A8cEIq

We’ll learn about directing actors and the basics of film blocking. 

Does the idea of watching two people having a conversation sound exciting? Probably not. You probably wouldn’t pay money to see that. And yet you do every time you go to the movies.

How have so many filmmakers managed to make those conversations exciting?

Well, one big way is with film blocking. Film blocking is the “precise staging of actors in a performance”. In terms of cinema, it’s where you place your actors in the frame.

It’s more than who stands where. Film blocking conveys the mood and tone you convey with what happens in the frame. We’ll use film blocking and mis-en-scene to bolster your knowledge so you can take everything you learn on set. 

We’ll incorporate Film Theory, Film Criticism, and practical reasoning to show you how to get the most out of your efforts.

In this video you’ll learn about Space, Shapes, and Lines in film blocking. By considering these components, you’ll be able to block a scene between any subjects in a visually dynamic way that is loaded with subtext.

So start watching and learn more about film blocking today!

ivAbJlEj0jA,Spike Jonze Homepod & Visual Contrast: Filmmaking Techniques for Directors (Directing Example),2018-07-17 12:30:00+00:00,"Good stories start with good scripts. But they don’t end there. A script is just a beginning. In a visual medium the finished product has to be… well… visual. So how do you turn a good script into good visuals and what filmmaking techniques should you use? http://bit.ly/2KZPY2e

There is actually a one word answer to that question. Contrast.

CONTRAST is to VISUALS…. what CONFLICT is to a SCRIPT.

Contrast is the gas pedal and the brakes. If you know when to accelerate and when to slow down, you can drive your story anywhere...and your audience will enjoy the ride.

There’s contrast in tone… In art direction… In blocking…  In camera movement… in color...pretty much in every part of a video.

So we thought we would cover one of the best ads of 2018, Spike Jonze’s “Homepod” commercial, and see how he uses visual contrast to promote his visual storytelling.

Stay tuned for other entries into the series.

dQV2-6_0ZeY,Medium Shot In Film: Examples and Film Theory,2018-07-11 12:00:03+00:00,"When you block a scene it’s important to think about how the audience takes in information. Every shot and edit matters. Camera angles and camera shots define the theme and tone of a story as much as color and acting. http://bit.ly/2NA54sO

Today we’re going to go over the Medium Shot, how it’s used, and why it’s important for every filmmaker to use to help accentuate their film or scene’s message.

So let’s dive in!

The Medium Shot usually goes unnoticed in film. These shots are oftentimes used to frame groups of people. Or one person with lots of stuff around them. The Medium Shot doesn’t play favoritee.

Everything is on the same plane and allows you to focus on the whole instead of the individual.

Sometimes called the Mid shot, or  “Waist Shot,” and denoted as MS on camera breakdown sheets, the Medium Shot is very popular.

The Medium Shot is usually used to provide scale between the subject and their surroundings, or to provide a more intimate perspective of a room while still giving some broader detail.

The main criteria is that the Medium Shot gives detail to the audience but tricks them into thinking they’re still viewing everything as a whole.

With the rise in people watching things at home or on smaller screens, the close up has become a tool just to make people feel close to the actors without earning it.

What happened to close ups that mattered?

This video essay will delve into the art of the camera angle and dissect five filmmakers distinctive take on the close up shot and what makes each of them unique.

We follow Steve McQueen, The Farrelly Brothers, Kathryn Bigelow, and David Fincher across their work as directors to see how each gives a clever and unique thrust to the close up and allows the audience to come along for the ride.

We spend time highlighting dramatic, informative, and comedic moments all accentuated by the close up camera angle.

Today, we’re going to do a script breakdown on a scene from Creed’s screenplay. 

The film, directed by Ryan Coogler, has some of the most emotional and nuanced scenes in any Rocky film. 

We’ll spend some time in Adrian’s restaurant with Rocky and Adonis, identifying all the elements you’d have to tag for each department for your Script Breakdown sheet. 

It’s an electrifying scene where even the tiniest details matter. 

Make sure you tag them! 

Creating a script breakdown is about identifying various “elements” in a scene to better understand its shooting requirements.

Script breakdowns are typically put together by the 1st AD or Producer during the pre-production phase prior to the shooting schedule.

In this video, we’ll review the complete process of marking (or “tagging”) scenes to create a script breakdown sheet while showing you why StudioBinder should be your first choice on set.

The corner bell just rang. 

Let’s eat lightning and crap thunder!

This video will show you EXACTLY how Steven Spielberg keeps audiences engaged like nobody else with 'point of thought'. Read more about Spielberg's directing style ►► http://bit.ly/2kxo2mD

Here’s what we’ll go over in this video:

First off we’ll talk about where Spielberg learned first developed his technique. It starts with another acclaimed direction, the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock and his use of the POV shot.

From there we’ll show how Spielberg made this fundamental cinematic tool his own, and took the movie experienced to new heights with his variation which we call ""Point of Thought.""

Next we’ll go through some of the best examples of this tool at work. Some you’ll remember, and some where you’ll be shocked at how the director was working without you even knowing it.

Finally I’ll show you how I took what I learned from watching and studying both of these masters and applied it to my own short film.

These are easy to use filmmaking tools that any director can incorporate into their shot lists and storyboard.

Got your own take on it? Great examples I left out? Your own personal twist? Leave a comment below and let’s get into it.

You start a script, get halfway done, but because you can’t figure out the ending, you abandon it, then start a new one. And then it happens again. And again. ►► http://bit.ly/2H4HiFY

So writer/producer Dan Harmon tackled this problem.

He took centuries of storytelling principles and turned them into an easy-to-use guide for building a compelling story.

One circle. Eight steps. 

Understanding good narrative structure won’t just make you a better writer.

It’ll make you a better storyteller. 

Today, we’re going to look at Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Dark Knight’, a film with a seemingly complex plot, that we can break down into the 8 steps of the story circle.

The theory boils down to three sentences: 

(1) A character is comfortable (2) but they see something they want, (3) So they head out into uncharted territory to get it (4) but have to change in order to succeed. (5) When they finally grasp it, (6) they pay a hefty price (7) and return to their original situation (8) having changed inside (and sometimes outside). 

Keep watching and see how this applies to Batman!

1. Nothing can ruin a take like unwanted background noise. Check for air traffic, boat traffic, regular traffic, trains, subways, and appliances.

2. Check for anachronisms. Examples. Aircraft in the background, cars in ""Ancient Rome"" or any unwanted logos. If necessary, VFX it out.

3. Is there enough space for everything? Your location isn't just the set. It must accommodate gear, trucks, and expendables. That includes parking.

4. Double check power sources. Do you have access to outlets? No? Bring a generator. 

5. Know the weather. How often does it rain? Or snow? Hail? Or whatever this is (it's a typhoon). 

6. Don't forget about sunrise and sunset. You might need extra lighting equipment.

7. Get permission to access. Lights, breakers, HVAC, modifications. 

8. Most importantly, make sure you get it all in writing.

Transcript:

How To Shoot Action Comedies Like Kingsman.

1. Make your hero the underdog. Underdogs can't win on their own. So they use the lement of surprise. Which makes for thrilling action and surprising punchlines. 

2. Push your violence over the top. Violence can be funny when it's extremely gorey. When it goes on forever. Or made surreal.

3. Sling one-liners. Use one-liners before fights, after fights, during fights, basically anytime. Punctuate tense confrontations with silly quips. 

4. Subvert stereotypes. Most action films feature the same story formulas. So flip them. e.g. Everyone's expecting a big bad villain. So make him lame as hell.

5. Hire Colin Firth. I mean, what can't this man do. But seriously. Find actors that can deliver both a joke and a bone-crushing punch. Sure, you can teach actors to do both. But what will they teach you?

3 Ways To Make On-Screen Texting Actually Look Good

1. Keep texting to a minimum. Limit the cuts between characters and phones. It can get repetitive quickly.

2. Superimpose text messages in unique places. This allows you to focus on the character's emotions. And keeps the story flowing. 

3. Extreme closeups of screens build suspense. See what your characters are discovering in real-time. Think of it as a POV shot.

Transcript:

How To Capture Loneliness On-Screen Like Spike Jonze

1. Get up-close and personal. Close-ups put us in the character's head. We feel their intensity and vulnerability.

2. Go wide. When characters feel small, make them look small. Just look at how isolated he looks. Poor guy.

3. Montage, montage, montage. Isolation usually occurs gradually. Condense it with a montage. Reveal a tragic backstory in under 30 seconds.

4. Turn off the gimmicks. When it comes to loneliness, less is more. Simple shots bring emotional rawness. Super sad, right?

3 Film Editing Techniques from Star Wars

#1. Make Eye Contact: A look can say it all. With no words, we understand everyone’s relationship.

#2. Cut With Passion: Hold on a shot longer to underscore a character's emotion. As Luke finds out about his dad, we keep it on him to  emphasize his emotional arc.

#3. Pace Your Shots: How long you linger on an image creates emotion while longer shots emphasize inner conflict.

Transcript:

5 Shooting Schedule Pro Tips that Build Momentum on Set: Part 2

#1: Be efficient with a 2nd unit crew.

Make the most of your downtime. Have the 2nd unit shoot b-roll during breaks between shots or scenes. 
Or they can shoot extra coverage alongside the primary unit.

# 2: Be smart about MOS

MOS (motor-only sync), means you’re shooting without synchronous audio track. If your scenes don’t require sound, schedule them at the beginning or end of the day when your entire crew is not needed.
Don’t keep people standing around when they’re not needed.

#3: Spread out milestone accomplishments to build enthusiasm.

Stunts. Explosions. Choreography. Complex blocking. Emotional performances. After a big, complicated or emotional scene is in the can, everyone is amped and energized. 

#4: Schedule a scene each day that allows each department to shine.

Aim to fill a day with exciting camera work, complex sound planning, or art-department perfection. Showcase a department’s big moment, and they’ll feed off the energy.

#5: Schedule night shoots before a day off.

Your crew will get some needed R&R…...come back, ready for more.

5 Shooting Schedule Pro Tips that Build Momentum on Set

# 1: Start the day strong with a quick win. Shooting a scene soon after call time shows everyone you’re on it, and there was good reason to show up at that time.

#2: Shape each day around the ebb and flow of your talent’s creative energy and they’ll deliver better performances. When scheduling scenes, ask yourself: Who’s working hardest in this scene? Who needs a break after the last scene? Who hasn’t been busy for a while?

#3: Schedule scenes chronologically when possible. It’ll make continuity a lot simpler and talent will be energized when they can better follow the path of the story

#4: Schedule easy scenes between really hard scenes. After a long go at a difficult scene, getting in a few quick wins back to back will show progress and lift spirits.

#5: Plan for changes in weather. Be prepared to swap scenes and days around if weather doesn’t cooperate. Consider indoor locations as fallbacks.
